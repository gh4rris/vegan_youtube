2w5AWKDdV9g,This Speech Will Make You Go Vegan! - Clif Grant at The Irish Vegan Festival,"It's been a couple of years since I last spoke at the Irish Vegan Festival due to the awful lockdowns that we have all endured. I recently came across this speech from the last time the festival took place.

I talk about my early years and my journey to veganism, I tell the story of the what the animals have to endure and leave a message of hope at the end.

I really hope you enjoy it; and if you aren't already vegan, that it touches your heart in some way.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I'll be discussing this simple concept along with related issues such as diet, health, the environment and epidemiology.

Finally, I'll be talking about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

iVXsjWxaTFQ,"Animal Liberation Front (ALF) –Raid Interfauna, 1990–","17 March 1990 – ALF liberates more than 100 animals from laboratory animal breeder Interfauna.

On this day in 1990 one of the most famous Animal Liberation Front raids in history was successfully completed. Activists broke into Interfauna, a supplier of animals for laboratories, and rescued 82 beagles and 26 rabbits. At that point it was the largest number of dogs taken in a single action.


El 17 de marzo de 1990 se completó con éxito una de las incursiones del Frente de Liberación Animal (ALF) más famosas de la historia. Lxs activistas entraron en Interfauna, un proveedor de animales para laboratorios del Reino Unido y rescataron a 82 cachorros beagles y 26 conejos. En ese momento era el mayor número de perros liberados en una sola acción. 

Aquí se cuenta la acción con todo detalle: 
https://network23.org/redblackgreen/2018/03/17/flashback-17-march-1990-alf-liberates-more-than-100-animals-from-laboratory-animal-breeder-interfauna/


* ¿Cual fue tu sensación cuando oías tu sentencia por la liberación de Interfauna? ¿De cuanto tiempo fue? ¿Cómo se hizo tal acción?

John Curtin: Recuerdo muy bien la sensación que sentí cuando recibí la sentencia de 18 meses por una liberación en Interfauna. ¡Me sentí bien! Miré fijamente al juez pensando “no te atrevas a intentar darme lecciones” y dejé que sus palabras me entrasen por un oído y saliesen por otro. Pensé en lo irónico de la situación. Estaba tan feliz de pensar que, aunque me iban a encerrar en una jaula, 82 beagles y 26 conejos habían encontrado un hogar en el que los cuidarían.

La acción de Interfauna es otra historia, como veo que esta entrevista se está extendiendo mucho, me limitaré a decir esto… la preparación y ejecución de la acción transcurrieron como un atraco a un banco, ¡solo que mucho más complicado! Tuvimos que planear la acción y hacer vigilancias durante semanas, para que quedase todo bien preparado. Esa noche tuvimos que trabajar realmente duro. Y después varias semanas de más trabajo, buscando hogares seguros para los animales liberados. Pero el sentimiento que se tiene cuando ya ha terminado todo y ha salido bien… te sientes alegre de haber nacido.

Hello Beans

While at a vigil for Regan Russell outside a slaughter house in Bristol, we had the honour of hearing Dr Alice speaking about her time working in the same slaughter house we were standing outside. this is the recording of the speech she gave.

I am hoping that those of you listening to what she has to say will get involved in some activism.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

Today I’m discussing spirituality and veganism. It’s a subject I’ve wanted to talk about for a long time but the recent video from Sophia Esperanza about why she’s no longer vegan gave me the final push to discuss my thoughts on this issue. I strongly believe that tying in whimsical and often anti-science beliefs with veganism is not a positive thing for veganism or the animals. In this video I explain why.

yx2ddLulyJQ,INTENSE exchange between Speciesist and Animal Rights Activist  | Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"A speciesist stopped by a vegan demonstration to share her beliefs. Things got pretty heated...

Question? How would you have responded to her points? Would there have been anything different you would have brought up? Do you believe this speciesist has any authority to speak about health and how plant-based eating is unhealthier than her diet?

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos. 

***** What is Speciesism? *****
Speciesism, in applied ethics and the philosophy of animal rights, the practice of treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species; also, the belief that this practice is justified.

Original video by @arvindanimalactivist8192: ""Are Plants And Animals The Same? | Did Science Prove That Plants Feel Pain?""
 https://youtu.be/VRjVs868tlI

FYI plants don’t have a central nervous system, aren’t sentient and can’t feel pain, but even if they could, more plants are killed to feed animals for meat dairy and eggs, going vegan kills less plants. Plant Lives Matter ✊🏻

Ed Winters is a vegan educator, public speaker and content creator based in London, England. Winters is the co-founder and co-director of Surge, an animal rights organisation determined to create a world where compassion towards all non-human animals is the norm. In 2016 Surge founded The Official Animal Rights March which succeeded in a growth from 2,500 participants in London in 2016 to 28,000 participants across the world in 2018. In 2017 Winters produced the documentary Land of Hope and Glory and launched the on-going moving activism project The Big Vegan Activism Van. He has spoken at over 1/3 of UK universities and has given speeches across the world.

l3eYtUv3baU,CARNIVORE DESTROYS VEGAN JOAQUIN PHOENIX | Primal Edge Health Mukbang Response,"Hey guys!!

So, as you all know, #JoaquinPhoenix delivered an inspiring speech at the 2020 Oscars where he used his immense platform to speak up for the victims of animal agriculture. Not surprisingly, many meat eaters were triggered by this amazing display of #vegan activism— #carnivore Primal Edge Health being one of them.

Here, we offer our response to his reaction of Joaquin's speech.

What are your thoughts? What did you think of the speech? And what do you think of Primal Edge Health's reaction? Let us know below!

Today's video:

In today's video, I'm back on GB News taking on a panel that question me about plant-based alternatives, the healthfulness of vegan diets, and I almost get whiplash reacting to baffling questions about protein and 'false vegetables'. 

Mike Parry has referred to himself as a 'sausage expert' and yet infamously ate a vegan sausage sandwich believing that it was meat and called it 'luscious and lovely'.

n0goqFH9BQM,What Is The Animal Liberation Movement? - The Ethical Compass,"What Is The Animal Liberation Movement? In this informative video, we will discuss the animal liberation movement, a crucial effort aimed at ending the suffering and exploitation of non-human animals. This movement advocates for the rights and welfare of animals, emphasizing our moral responsibility to treat them with respect. We will explore the concept of speciesism, which prioritizes human interests over those of other species, and how this movement challenges that belief. 

Key thinkers like Peter Singer and Tom Regan have shaped the philosophical foundation of animal liberation, presenting different approaches to animal rights. We'll examine how their ideas influence practical changes in areas such as factory farming and animal testing. Additionally, we will reflect on the ethical implications of our actions regarding animal welfare and how empathy can guide our moral choices. 

Join us as we delve into the importance of extending moral consideration beyond humans and consider the impact our feelings toward animals can have on our decision-making. This discussion is vital for anyone interested in advocating for the rights and welfare of animals. Subscribe to our channel for more engaging conversations about ethics and morality!

CDXPz3QbUNo,THIS VEGAN WILL MAKE YOU THINK - Guy Scared To Watch Speech In Case It Makes Him Change,"Back on the streets again... encouraging and empowering people to live compassionately and to encourage them to make everyday choices that reflect the values that they already hold.

It was cool to have a conversation with someone from my home town!

If you would like to support my work I've taken the decision to start a Patreon. My reasons for doing so are on the link below...

https://www.patreon.com/ClifGrant?utm...

Ultimately I'm trying to make people stop for a moment and think - and to reconnect with the compassion for animals that already lies inside most of us.

If we take the time to inform people properly, together, one step at a time, one change at a time,  – when it all adds up, it will be one enormous result for the animals.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I also hope to talk about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

This is the first time I've ever had someone bring up plant feelings during street outeach. I never talk to people from a food angle. Never! That's why it's interesting with this bystander because there was never a food discussion in this conversation. It seemed to be where he always wanted to focus though. No matter what I said to him, all he wanted to do was talk about the oppression he puts in his mouth. I also asked him 4 times what he would do if he and his family were in the victim's position and not once did he answer. 

I may have lost my cool a bit on this one but compared to what I actually wanted to say, I think it was ok. Nothing worse than standing next to an actual animal oppressor with actual blood on their hands. You always want to remain as professional as possible though, regardless of who you're speaking to. Our emotions can't always be controlled but it's a must you find a way to balance them. The best thing to do when you feel you're about to lose control is walk away. You're never obligated to stand and talk with anyone.

vBx7MGIZ1fU,Philip Wollen - Most Inspiring Speech on Animal Rights!,"After accepting the Albert Schweitzer award at Last Chance for Animals' 2017 Annual Gala, Philip Wollen delivered a phenomenal speech about the egregious treatment of animals and the destructive ramifications of their plight.

wc1PN_CsOdA,Vegetarian Told She Still Participates In Violence |  Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"During the AV: Unity cube in Calgary, Alberta, a vegetarian and her friend stopped to speak with a vegan activist. The vegetarian was given the facts about how her lifestyle was causing immense suffering and cruelty. Watch how she reacted.

Do you think she went vegan? Let us know in the comment section down below. 

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos. 

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless. To join in on animal rights activism: cubeoftruth.com

DAY 3 #SMITHFIELDTRIAL - 2 Men Face Decade Prison Term for Piglet Rescue!

#UnchainedTV is LIVE at the courthouse for the ongoing Utah TRIAL of Direct Action Everywhere co-founder Wayne Hsiung and #DxE member Paul Picklesimer. These two men face over a DECADE in prison for removing 2 piglets they said were very sick as they videotaped themselves inside a massive Utah pig factory farm. There, they videotaped conditions described this way by the New York Times: “The film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.” 
Our team coverage includes commentary by famed attorney Lisa Bloom, Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, well-known attorney Nathan Semmel, Gwenna Hunter, founder of Vegans for Black Lives Matter, famed animal rescuer Simone Reyes, trial watcher Karen La Cava and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah to find out what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

If I have to listen to him blabber about mice in basements one more time, I might lose it. Nothing more cringe than a non-vegan taking issue with vegans when they're paying to breed and murder animals their entire life. Could you be any more disingenuous?

WgGdLx_yT9U,Vegan CRUSHED by Meat eaters,"Vegan crushed by meat eaters...

They were watching a video of sick piglets being k!lled and dy!ng in farms

Can’t we all agree, meat eaters and vegans, this is disturbing and wrong?

Most animals k!lled for meat are under 2 years old, not much older than these piglets

Can you imagine an animal you care about going through that?

w81NRCt6Z2I,BREAKING: WORLD-FIRST EXPOSÉ | HUGE EGG HEN GAS CHAMBER SLAUGHTERHOUSE (UK),"*Background:* In August and September of 2024, In a world first investigation, my team and I captured the first ever footage from inside a CO2 gas chamber pit system used to kill end of lay egg hens. 

CO2 is an aversive gas, which burns the hen’s throat, eyes and lungs. Acidosis causes the hen’s blood and tissues to become acidic, as they suffocate in agony.

The hens clearly exhibit signs of severe pain, fear and distress with high-pitched vocalisations, gasping, and smashing into each other and the crates. 

And most shockingly, Many hens in a desperate attempt to escape the aversive gas, jump from the trays and fall many metres hitting the bottom of the pit.

The HCF Abattoir, in Bradford, is Red tractor and RSPCA assured, and kills over half of the spent layers in the UK, many of whom are from free range or organic farming systems.

The flesh from the birds is sold as chicken meat for human consumption in many UK outlets including butchers, restaurants and large supermarkets like Tesco, and many more.

Do not support the egg industry. Please live vegan.

Sunday Forum, December 11, 2022

#righttorescue 

Animal rights activist Wayne Hsiung is an attorney, former faculty member at Northwestern School of Law, and co-founder of the Simple Heart Initiative. His work documenting disease and animal abuse at factory farms has been covered by The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. He recently faced trial on felony charges related to an investigation and piglet rescue at the largest pig farm in the nation, and was acquitted by a Utah jury on October 8, 2022, a victory for the ""right to rescue."" Wayne blogs and hosts a podcast at simpleheart.substack.com.

Wayne talked about his commitment to animal welfare and his research into how present methods of processing meat have an adverse effect on the environment and both animal and human health.

The Impact of Veganism on Animal Liberation: Empowering Change

In this impactful video, we explore the profound relationship between veganism and animal liberation. Join us as we delve into the core principles of veganism and how this lifestyle choice can contribute to a significant transformation in the lives of animals. Through thought-provoking discussions and inspiring stories, we shed light on the power of veganism as a tool for advocacy and the pursuit of a world where animals are free from exploitation and cruelty. Let's embark on this journey of compassion and justice together.

wG1-QRhzoCo,Vegan MP Speech that had Colleagues in Tears,"Vegan MP, The Hon. Emma Hurst gave her first speech in NSW Parliament. Addressing the Upper House for the first time, new senator for the Animal Justice Party, Emma Hurst, criticized the Government for failing to protect animals, and implored members from both sides of Parliament to work with her to change the way our society treats animals in NSW. 

In her address she said, “Animal cruelty is not a left or right issue. But sadly it is one that our government has failed to respond to. And that’s why I decided to become part of this Parliament. I believe in NSW we can do better.” 

“The fate of each of these animals rests with our willingness to choose kindness over greed, respectability over indifference, and to be leaders instead of led.” The vegan bodybuilding MP spoke of the 4Corner’s live animal export vision exposed in 2011 and gave explicit examples of animal suffering on farms in NSW which saw visitors in the gallery and various MPs in tears.

The MP’s promise ‘to the animals’, was the climax of her speech stating, “No matter if you are skin, scales, fur or feathers, no matter the supposed value of your financial worth, or lack thereof, native or non-native, rodent, or fish, or cow, or dog, I will protect you. I stand by you. I will fiercely defend you. It is our party that will keep that promise, and we will never, ever let you down. You have all of me.”

She is now one of two Animal Justice Party MPs elected to the upper house in NSW who hold the balance of power with nine other crossbenchers.",Emma Hurst,0,3,4,5,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3808444540856787,0.3703490630112195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458627605494373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16090851468876308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14913777209446166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15196067073459413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5993017952504447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11505862768702647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14341930019193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422501977545633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37640587318460267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12742669186173688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15252121618891012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14913777209446166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310410380280411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.005850790740143,8.682199026000504,5.393627546352361,0.6931471805599453,7.030857476116121,13.047165946037925,11.515417255122571,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Up next, What is effective altruism? Philosopher Peter Singer explains. ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdXKak-k6zw

What does it mean to live ethically in our interconnected world? Author, activist, and philosopher Peter Singer argues that moral progress depends not on tradition or emotion, but on reason—and that each of us has the power to reduce suffering and improve lives through conscious choices that reduce ‘Speciesism.’ 

Singer’s perspective asks viewers to move beyond thought, asking them to act in alignment with their moral compasses.

About Peter Singer:

Peter Singer has been described as the world’s most influential philosopher. Born in Melbourne in 1946, he has been professor of bioethics at Princeton University since 1999. His many books include Animal Liberation - often credited with triggering the modern animal rights movement - Practical Ethics, The Life You Can Save, The Most Good You Can Do, and Ethics in the Real World. In 2023, he published Animal Liberation Now, a fully revised and updated version of the 1975 original.

Singer’s writings have also inspired the movement known as effective altruism, and he is the founder of the charity The Life You Can Save. In 2021 he was awarded the $1 million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture, which he donated to nonprofit organizations working for the causes he supports. In 2023 he received the Frontiers of Knowledge Prize for the Humanities, from the Spanish BBVA Foundation.",Big Think,1,13,4,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,71,0.7588397716305217,0.4925372329420142,0.04443271225193889,0.0,0.05548113474693292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024741575323465926,0.0,0.027231559783364757,0.0,0.0,0.05657325051895886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025581517641976637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13971287023660775,0.03396565843853357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02828662525947943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02337325471562974,0.031842369868229914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018433241355892655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0522985002259774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02008890637936761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02903030102948408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030032452171313614,0.015902581791849012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02710952481287494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05164587635699275,0.0,0.0,0.025103331390155054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340613738740912,0.0,0.04966078550882872,0.0,0.04862520453300284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027873402439823787,0.0,0.0,0.02903030102948408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019451737299804712,0.0,0.022738652759513513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11489573023898811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021104641208748255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026306700625647505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022738652759513513,0.0,0.22092229940902597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028723932559747027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030213303942238798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026092257884821387,0.02149532344120608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06117726282931441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023673494164754068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675322622606603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026306700625647505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438152403241683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01710949864514478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017077630294401572,0.0996810955697898,0.03401617239670002,0.0,0.05971171226720642,0.0,0.09428767013904042,7.268317492676769,20.6285239403386,15.893701442898895,9.1557785839835,8.839566503657949,3.7084297692661887,16.507190009996005,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

✅ How to effectively engage with non-vegans without pandering
✅ Why ethics, not health or the environment, should be the focus of outreach
✅ The psychology behind non-vegan guilt, resistance, and excuses
✅ AV's Outreach Flowchart—a step-by-step guide to impactful conversations
✅ The power of walking away from unproductive discussions

Aaron Bastani speaks to Earthling Ed, author of 'This is Vegan Propaganda: (And Other Lies the Meat Industry Tells You).

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter and We The Free Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos.

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless. To join in on animal rights activism: cubeoftruth.com OR activism.wtf

Odagn88_E0A,A New Approach to the CARNIVORE vs VEGAN Debate,"Is it time to rethink the entire carnivore vs. vegan debate?

In this video from The Healthy Life, re-uploaded by Plant Based News, we hear a fresh perspective on one of the most heated topics in nutrition. Instead of choosing sides, this video challenges the processed foods both vegans and meat eaters often rely on—and shifts the focus to one simple principle: eat whole foods found in nature.

From nutrient density and gut health to longevity and ethics, this is a deep dive into what really drives health—beyond the labels of carnivore or vegan.

📌 Why people feel better on both diets
📌 The real issue with junk food vegans
📌 What paleo humans actually ate
📌 The role of fiber, hormones, and cancer risk
📌 Why long-term health is about what you don’t eat

Let’s go beyond the extremes and get to the root of what matters.

aBoKLPiA_OQ,Sharon Núñez on Wayne Hsiung Verdict: Insights from Animal Equality's President,"Animal Equality joins fellow animal protection organizations and nearly 100 of advocates to show support for Wayne Hsiung–an attorney who was recently jailed for rescuing sick and dying animals from factory farms.

On the farms, which are associated with Whole Foods and Costco, Hsiung and over a hundred advocates captured footage of criminal animal cruelty and neglect. Law enforcement did not seek legal action against the farm despite the evidence. Instead, Hsiung and fellow advocates were arrested, and Hsiung was convicted of two misdemeanors and one felony charge.

Today, November 30th, Hsiung faced years in prison. President, Sharon Núñez, and Executive Vice President, Jose Valle, traveled to Santa Rosa to show their support on behalf of Animal Equality. Ultimately, Hsiung was sentenced to 90 days of imprisonment and two years of probation, during which he will be prohibited from speaking to his colleagues.

EoDOi0rvejY,Earthling Ed: From Meat-eater to Leading Vegan Activist | The Viva! Vegan Podcast,"Ed Winters is a vegan educator, best-selling author, public speaker and content creator, widely known for his viral debates, speeches, and video essays. 
 
In this episode, Issy sits down with Ed to discuss his new book How to Argue With a Meat Eater (And Win Every Time), his nine-year vegan journey, how his mindset shifted from thinking vegans were humourless and attention seekers, to being one of the leading voices in the movement.  

In this conversation Issy and Ed discuss topics, such as:

- Ed’s childhood and how university changed his mindset 
- Specism 
- Rupert the Hamster, his companion animal and his love of broccoli   
- Expression, vulnerability in having your views questioned  
- Culture wars and pseudo science  
- Critical thinking

KmwjF4WSor0,The War on Compassion: In Conversation with Wayne Hsiung,"Wayne Hsiung is an open rescue superhero. He's an animal rights lawyer who's represented himself at trial. He's an AR movement philosopher and strategist. And he's even done animal advocacy from jail.

In this Animal Justice Academy event, we talk to Wayne about his journey leading investigations and rescues from factory farms and slaughterhouses across the U.S. with Direct Action Everywhere, serving as lead counsel for four “right to rescue” trials of activists being prosecuted, his own criminal prosecutions and time in jail, and his new organization The Simple Heart Initiative.

We discuss topics including:

- the attempted silencing of animal advocacy and what we do to fight it
- how he's on pins and needles over the Ridglan Farms case decision that could mean freedom for 3000 beagles from a research breeding facility
- The Simple Heart Initiative's mission to build a mass movement for rescuing sick and dying animals in factory farms
- the elements that make open rescue such a powerful animal advocacy strategy
- how humans protecting the most powerless in our society is a necessary ingredient for building a more healthy, democratic world
- how we, as an individuals, can help to build a world where compassion is celebrated instead of criminalized

uuO3aJqkPo8,Wayne Hsiung @ the All Day Vigil in Toronto,"Wayne Hsiung at the All Day Vigil in Toronto on 14 June 2016.
Wayne Hsiung is a lawyer, writer, and co-founder of the global animal rights network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) and lead investigator in the DxE Open Rescue Network. His work as an investigator has been reported on in The New York Times and Mother Jones, and he organizes grassroots campaigns that have mobilized activists in over 110 cities and 20 countries. Prior to DxE, Wayne studied behavioral economics as a NSF Graduate Fellow at MIT, taught at Northwestern School of Law (where he co-authored research with Harvard’s Cass Sunstein on climate change’s impact on animals), and practiced securities law at two national law firms while maintaining a pro bono animal practice. Despite holding two graduate degrees, he is regularly outwitted by his four furry companions.

We also discuss Wayne's investigation of the dog meat trade in Yulin, China, his rescue of dogs from ""farms"" there, and China's 2020 ban on dog meat.

Update: Wayne has now been released from prison, but several DxE activists, including Wayne, still face felony charges. Meanwhile, the animal agribusinesses DxE investigated have faced no charges for their widespread violations of animal welfare regulations--which would do little to protect animals from pain and suffering even if they were enforced.

m5rKjgrTneA,Trolling 101. Trolling Vegan Gains' Trolls.  Making funny comments to his haters.,"Welcome to Trolling 101.  I show you how to troll the trolls.  Haters gonna hate, we know that, but can they take it back?  Let's see ;)  This is episode 2 in the series.  First episode, I trolled Durianrider's trolls https://youtu.be/wqr_oCT1uYQ and got a lot of demands for a second episode, so here we are.
I respond to Vegan Gains' most hateful comments in a funny manner without being overly rude.  Although I can't help it sometimes ;)  I love watching ""Reading mean comments"" videos, and this is taking it to the next level.  Enjoy!

ABOUT THE OXFORD UNION SOCIETY: The Oxford Union is the world's most prestigious debating society, with an unparalleled reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to Oxford. Since 1823, the Union has been promoting debate and discussion not just in Oxford University, but across the globe.

The Oxford Union is deeply grateful and encouraged by the messages of support in response to our determination to uphold free speech. During our 200 year history, many have tried to shut us down. As the effects of self-imposed censorship on university campuses, social media and the arts show no signs of dissipating, the importance of upholding free speech remains as critical today as it did when we were founded in 1823.

hDj82CQE2Rk,Corona Controversies | Interview with Mic The Vegan,"5 DELICIOUS DINNER RECIPES to support your weight loss:
https://www.chefaj.com/5-delicious-low-fat-dinner-recipes

Today I had the pleasure of talking to Mic The Vegan who I met at a vegan influencer conference last year and was immediately impressed by.

Mic the Vegan is a vegan science YouTuber that covers a variety of topics from the health effects of a vegan diet and the environmental impact of eating animal products to the sociological phenomenon of casual animal exploitation. Based in the Iowa, he regularly tackles debunking the myths that perpetuate harmful dietary and lifestyle behaviors - all with a drop of humor that only he thinks is funny. Key facts: Mic is short for microphone and Mike/Michael, NOT MICK! He is not a doctor but he is currently studying Public Health at the Master's level.  Please check out his extraordinary channel at youtube.com/c/micthevegan.

oywQtMrulhg,Why Go Vegan? | The Most IMPORTANT Speech You Will Hear Today!,"This vegan speech could change the way you think and change how you live your life. Filmed at Exeter University, UK 2017.

Why Vegan? My names Chris Hines and I'm a vegan, animal rights activist from the UK. After watching a video called 'Meet Your Meat' back in 2002, I was confronted with the reality of what happens to animals in our food system and this set me on the path to living a vegan lifestyle. I felt terrible knowing that I had been contributing to what I had seen for so many years and felt betrayed by the system that kept all these horrors tucked away from the publics eyes. 

What I have come to realise is that what we are doing to animals is wrong and we have a way to help fix this. This is speech I gave at Exeter University in January of 2017 which discusses the ethics of veganism and how we lack the justifications to be treating animals in this way. Please watch with an open mind and open heart. You can really help make a difference.

If you need any information on going vegan or want to discuss anything you have heard in this video then please get in contact using the links below. 

Thank you so much for watching and I really hope this inspires you to make a change for the animals, the planet and ourselves.

Much love

Chris x

🌱 200 g ready-to-cook udon noodles, see notes

Use your hands to crumble the tofu in a bowl until it reaches a mince-like consistency, then stir in the cornflour.

Add a small drizzle of oil to a non-stick wok or frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook for 7-10 minutes or until golden and crispy, stirring occasionally to break up any clumps of tofu.

Reduce the heat to low, then stir in the 5 spice, dark soy sauce and light soy sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.

Meanwhile, for the noodles, add most of the spring onion (save some for topping), garlic, chilli oil, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, maple syrup and rice vinegar to a mixing bowl.

Cook the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, stirring gently to separate them. Then drain the noodles and stir them into the sauce.

Add the noodles to a serving bowl and top with the crispy tofu and remaining spring onion. We also love to drizzle extra chilli oil over the top, but this is optional!

nkbjNZhx4zk,Vegans need to live and let live!,"One of the reasons I went vegan was to respect the personal choice of others. After all, if animals were given the choice they wouldn’t choose to walk into the gas chamber or the stun box. They wouldn’t choose to be selectively bred, for their bodies to be mutilated, their reproductive systems exploited or for their babies to be forcibly taken from them.

Everything we do to animals involves their subjugation and the denial of their best interests, preferences or what they would choose to do if given the opportunity to have a choice. So when we talk about personal choice, do we really care about the freedoms of others, or are we simply trying to deflect from the fact that morally we have no justification for the needless suffering that we choose to cause to animals?

Ahc3-GJDXcU,Alex O’Connor Promotes Leather Wallet After Quitting Veganism?,"This was very disappointing, despite my being a fan of @cosmicskeptic’s work in the atheism and philosophy space. Hopefully we can get some clarity.

And just to be clear, when I went to his link it went straight to the leather Ekster wallet, which is made from leather, and the aluminum card holder. There is one charcoal vegan option among 5 leather options, and the one he held was not charcoal. 

And an additional detail I wanted to mention. As stated in the video, given that KT Trading says they source hides from some of the biggest U.S. meat processors, and that over 99% of meat in the U.S. comes from factory farms, it seems extremely likely the leather comes from factory-farmed animals.

Could they technically isolate hides from higher-welfare farms? Possibly. But they don’t claim to do that and. from what I understand, this would require an unusually strict and transparent supply chain, which I see no evidence of here. I’m hoping they can give me more specifics in response to my emails.",Danny Ishay,0,16,0,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22565451069485853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37398649784757787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36347990962329024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37585048402272253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31557759915021816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5169188485476469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12390868992568274,0.0,0.2376087155670587,0.0,0.0,0.2138627951172367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22691415300455195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.176448886562838,16.05771668021719,10.173552856959743,7.21081845347222,5.135798437050262,3.2396118012774835,10.019960132802336,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
AZyNMByzqCY,Alex O’Connor Says Veganism Doesn’t Work,"Ex-vegan Alex O'Connor (@CosmicSkeptic) says veganism doesn’t work. But what if it’s already working, and turning away from it could hurt animals more than help them? In this video, I respond to his key points and explain where his argument goes wrong.

Key Topics Discussed:

✅ Is veganism effective for animal rights
✅ Factory farming vs ethical meat debate
✅ The power of individual action in social change
✅ Cultural change vs legal reform
✅ The slavery analogy in vegan debates

Today's video:

In today's video I #debate Keane, a student in Boston who is unsure if k*lling homeless people is justifiable and thinks that growing humans in test tubes so that we can harvest their organs is ethical. However, how does all of this inform his views on eating animal products and can I get him to come around to #veganism?

DeCamp Professor of Bioethics in the University Center for Human Values, Princeton University, discusses 'Why Vegan?' with Donna Lyons, Trinity College Dublin School of Law on the day of its release, Thursday, 24 September 2020.

In this book, Peter Singer, one of the great moral philosophers of the modern age, asks unflinching questions about how we should live our lives. The ideas collected in these writings, arguing that human tyranny over animals is a wrong comparable to racism and sexism, triggered the animal rights movement and gave impetus to the rise in vegan eating.",Conversations with Dr. Donna Lyons ,0,12,3,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19547762420133752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18815333617425603,0.11435510450365886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15738549514259753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793844503962668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17641092457095978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1504519871349765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18768756416995894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19341467003032928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.743798112491368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1447403095634023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35427612918341156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12558659821804982,0.0,0.12041314581295562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.2317560764011233,10.657776868038312,6.270988431858299,3.367295829986474,8.098338846189057,12.025409123027968,8.443687733567568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

XVVLBHMcS60,The smell of burning dogs emanating from #RidglanFarms was reported to the USDA in 2006...,"Apparently, the facility was killing so many dogs that it was burning them to get rid of the corpses. But the USDA did nothing. Now two whistleblowers are coming forward with even more disturbing evidence of abuse, including a sick puppy thrown into a freezer bag to suffocate to death. We will be using their testimony as part of a petition to appoint a #SpecialProsecutor to investigate #RidglanFarms. If we prevail, 3000+ dogs will be saved. #RightToRescue

UcggEpU4hPE,BREAKING: Wayne Hsiung Speaks About His Trials!,"Dxe Co-Founder and leader of the Open Rescue Movement talks to UnchainedTV about his recent California conviction and the shocking, dropping of all felony charges against him in a 2017 Beagle Open Rescue case in Wisconsin, days before trial was set to start. You could call it a big victory for animal rights. Most people would be thrilled to avoid the possibility of 16 years in prison. But, the incredibly courageous Wayne Hsiung is not happy that he doesn’t get to show the world what’s happening to beagles in a court of law, arguing the real crime is animal cruelty, not rescuing. Wayne was just published in the Harvard Law Review at the same time as his law license is getting suspended due to his convictions in the Sonoma County Open Rescue trial. Joining him is noted attorney Mirais Holden.

jxWrb2tDEpA,Vegans Kill More Than Meat Eaters | Joey Carbstrong #shorts,"Vegans kill more animals and insects? Do you truly believe vegans are hypocrites because they ""don’t care about the animals in crop fields?”

This is no justification for eating meat but the best reason to go vegan. We also care about the mice, snakes, and other living beings in crop fields, which is why we choose vegan to reduce their suffering as well.

The animal agriculture industry is the driving force behind crop production and deforestation globally. A global shift to a plant-based diet uses less land overall, produces more calories, and hurts less animals.

Forum with with Wayne Hsiung
Sunday, February 9, 2025

The factory farming industry has been one of the largest contributors to the new administration and its key allies. These contributions have bought incredible influence, including tens of billions of dollars sent to industrial operations engaged in inhumane practices such as so-called “ventilation shutdowns.” Since 2022, more than 90 million poultry in 48 states have been “euthanized” due to the bird flu outbreak, which affects all animals. These factory farms cause depletion and pollution of our natural waterways and devastation to forests and natural resources. Now more than ever, we must be aware of this basic food production information.

Wayne Hsiung, a member of our UU Animal Ministry, is an attorney and internationally recognized animal rescuer and investigator. He co-founded animal rights organizations such as The Simple Heart Initiative. Wayne studied law and economics at the University of Chicago and taught at Northwestern School of Law and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Join us for this important update on our food systems and efforts to keep them safe and healthful!

His work as an investigator — including the rescue of a distressed hen named Mei Hua from a northern California egg farm — has been reported on in The New York Times and Mother Jones, and he organizes grassroots campaigns that have mobilized activists in over 110 cities and 20 countries. Prior to co-founding DxE, Wayne studied behavioral economics as a NSF Graduate Fellow at MIT, taught at Northwestern School of Law (where he co-authored research with Harvard’s Cass Sunstein on the impact of climate change on animals), and practiced securities law at two national law firms while maintaining a pro bono animal practice.

Qg8BdbPvhDk,Anti Vegan Psychopaths On Facebook (This Is Sick),"Anti vegan psychopaths on Facebook get triggered by vegans and show their true violent nature

Anti vegan means pro abuse - you're either vegan and against anti vegan abusers like this, or you're not vegan and you're on the same side as anti vegan abusers like this, because you're paying people just like them to do this to animals when you pay for animal products

RnK9nIrL7K8,What I Eat IN A WEEK as A Strong VEGAN // Easy High Protein Meals,"Hang out with me for a week to see what I eat and do to maintain my healthy vegan life!

I went Vegan 15 years ago and feel amazing! I've never looked back thanks to the delicious meals I make and proper supplementation.

I love to enjoy healthy, balanced meals with a good amount of protein that helps me build lean muscle and have lots of energy to support my active lifestyle.

hOK6xmolaJg,UnchainedTV Friday Coverage of the #SmithfieldTrial of Wayne Hsiung & Paul Picklesimer in Utah.,"Live on October 7th 2022: DAY 5 #SMITHFIELDTRIAL - 2 Men Face Decade Prison Term for Piglet Rescue! 

#UnchainedTV is LIVE at the courthouse for the ongoing Utah TRIAL of Direct Action Everywhere co-founder Wayne Hsiung and #DxE member Paul Picklesimer. These two men face over a DECADE in prison for removing 2 sick piglets from a massive Utah pig factory farm. There, they videotaped conditions described this way by the New York Times: “The film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.” 

Our team coverage includes commentary by well-known attorney Nathan Semmel, Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, Gwenna Hunter, founder of Vegans for Black Lives Matter, famed animal rescuer Simone Reyes, TheirTurn founder Donny Moss, Environmental Specialist Hoorik Telle, trial watcher Karen La Cava and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah to find out from #DxE leaders what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

********CRITIQUES, RULES, AND NOTES********

Be aware of the following rules before posting comments:
- Please do not post summaries of the video in the comments - it damages retention on the video and YouTube is less likely to promote it (these videos cost me a lot of money to produce). 

Critiques of my work are welcome! Please be aware of the following notes & rules before submitting critique:

Be mindful that this content is not all encompassing on the subject at hand and is self-limited for brevity to reach a wider audience. Also, be aware that I receive hundreds of YouTube comments per day, so the only way your critique can be considered is if you follow the steps outlined below. Finally, YouTube auto-deletes links, so I do not see most comments with links attached. 

RULES:
If your comment is rude, you will be banned.
If your comment is not about the studies/topics at hand (i.e. extending to other outcomes not discussed) or offers critique with no scientific basis, it is unlikely to receive a response.

If you can follow these rules, I will try to address your critique and if there is merit, I will add an AMENDMENT to the content in question and pin it so everyone can see it (thank you!). 

Please use the following link to submit your critique: https://bit.ly/PhysionicCritique

Today’s video:

When I was growing up, a day out at a zoo was one of my favourite activities. I loved seeing all the different animals and I never once questioned whether or not zoos were ethical, or if they actually did benefit the conservation of animals in the wild.

Interestingly, I stopped going to zoos before I became a vegan, with the last zoo I visited being Barcelona Zoo. I had recently seen the movie Blackfish and had become passionate about the captivity of marine animals, but I hadn’t yet extended that concern to the captivity of terrestrial animals as well.

However, as I was wandering around Barcelona Zoo I came across a bear enclosure, inside of which was a bear sat forlornly looking around. I followed the gaze of the bear as they looked at each of the walls of the enclosure and it suddenly hit me, these are wild animals being held captive. They have no agency, no chance of escape and no freedom.

We are often sold the idea that animals are well-cared for and happy in zoos and that zoos do important conservation work, but is this actually true? As is the case with farmed animals, we often mistake the fact that the animals are given food, water and medication as constituting care. However, providing the basic requirements for an animal to survive hardly constitutes genuine care and appreciation for the best interests of the animals.

It’s time to recognise zoos for what they really are, animal prisons that exist for the primary reason of making money.

Today’s video is an in-depth look into the ethics of zoos, and the arguments that they use to justify their existence.

zDA6jmzNOSI,UnchainedTV Saturday #SmithfieldTrial VERDICT WATCH for Wayne Hsiung & Paul Picklesimer in Utah.,"Live on October 8th 2022: VERDICT WATCH: #SMITHFIELDTRIAL - 2 Men Face 5 years Prison Term for Piglet Rescue! 

#UnchainedTV is LIVE at the courthouse for the ongoing Utah TRIAL of Direct Action Everywhere co-founder Wayne Hsiung and #DxE member Paul Picklesimer. These two men face 5 years in prison for removing 2 sick piglets from a massive Utah pig factory farm. There, they videotaped conditions described this way by the New York Times: “The film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.” 

Our team coverage includes commentary by well-known attorney Nathan Semmel, Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, Gwenna Hunter, founder of Vegans for Black Lives Matter, famed animal rescuer Simone Reyes, philanthropist Mick Davoudian, dog behavior consultant Maryam Kamali, trial watcher Karen La Cava and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah to find out from #DxE leaders what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

GeqltSiQRWU,Wayne Hsiung: Homo Ahimsa Award Speech,"Our Interfaith Vegan Coalition bestowed our third annual Homo Ahimsa Award to Wayne Hsiung and Priya Sawhney, co-founders of Direct Action Everywhere and The Simple Heart Initiative, for trailblazing the “Right To Rescue” animals who are suffering or injured and in need of veterinary attention. Together, they created a precedent-setting campaign to gain public support for animal rescue, raise awareness about the political and legal repression of animal rescuers, and ultimately establish the legal right to rescue animals from abuse in the agricultural industry, where it is common practice.

Ahimsa is the Sanskrit word for non-harm and nonviolence. Venerated champions of the teaching include Mahatma Gandhi, who took a vow of ahimsa that informed his life and his activism. The Interfaith Vegan Coalition grants the Homo Ahimsa Award to those who embody the Homo ahimsa qualities of nonviolence and compassion for all beings. Homo Ahimsa Award recipients demonstrate how vegan living can co-create a world of peace, partnership, and loving kindness by ending violence and domination to people, animals, and the Earth. The award is named after the book, ""Homo Ahimsa: Who We Really Are and How We’re Going to Save the World,"" by the Interfaith Vegan Coalition’s co-founder Judy Carman, who coined the term.

In this very calming episode of The Ranveer Show, we have with us a monk who sold his Maserati.
Very early on Palga Rinpoche realized the true purpose of spirituality and understood that materialism is not the answer to long-term happiness.

This episode delves into Buddhism, spirituality, and achieving peace and happiness. Palga Rinpoche has had an interesting life, from being recognized as a reincarnation to experiencing extreme wealth at a young age to sleeping on the sidewalk when he was poor.

Spirituality is a term for which each one of us has a different definition. But all of them circle into the honest belief in a higher power, the universe, & our own versions of God. It is something that needs to be done from a feeling of genuineness and deep belief. From this episode, I truly hope you find the answers you were looking for.

YXCIGcn7lfU,Peter Singer: Still optimistic after 50 years of Animal Liberation?,"50 years ago, Peter Singer published Animal Liberation, the influential book that, among other things, called for a boycott of meat. It was the starting point of the animal movement as we know it today. Two years ago, he released a revised edition: Animal Liberation Now. How does he look back on 50 years of the animal movement? Where do we stand today, and which strategies should we pursue for the future?

Peter Singer is a moral philosopher, now retired as a professor of bioethics at Princeton University.

1HZaRcQWOSA,Why Don't Farmers Slaughter Their Own Victims? |   Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"Why do you think farmers opt-out of the slaughter process? Let's discuss it in the comment section after watching this video.

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos. 

Edmonton is also starting a We The Free (WTF) chapter soon.

***** What is Speciesism? *****
Speciesism, in applied ethics and the philosophy of animal rights, the practice of treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species; also, the belief that this practice is justified.
https://www.britannica.com/topic/speciesism

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area*****
We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. A We The Free ""Diamond"" has a similar setup. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless. To join in on animal rights activism: cubeoftruth.com  OR https://www.activism.wtf/

DKyHqZyeQ-Q,The First Form of Discrimination You Are Taught | Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"A quick conversation between an animal rights activist and a non-vegan. The activist educated him on the first form of discrimination everyone is taught. 

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos.

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless. To join in on animal rights activism: cubeoftruth.com

GLW1A5s7Wws,How to lose weight on a vegan diet,"For many people who make the switch to a vegan diet, weight loss is inevitable. However, just because it's vegan doesn't mean that it's healthy :)

5. Get plenty of sleep, and stay avoid stress as much as possible.

All across the United States, people are transforming their lives with a plant-based diet. They are beating heart disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, obesity and cancer, and they want you to know that trying a vegan diet could change – or save – your life, too:  https://genv.org/why-vegan/for-your-health/

As well as containing refined oils and added sugars, the Standard American diet is typically heavy in meat, eggs and dairy, and is low in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. As a result, we are seeing a growing crisis of chronic disease, including some of the world’s biggest killers. Check out the testimony of a growing number of plant-based doctors who are promoting the healthcare benefits of a whole food plant-based diet: https://genv.org/why-vegan/for-your-health/

ZLPD_wQLQbQ,The Corporatization of Veganism & How Human and Animal Liberation are Interconnected,"Has the vegan movement been co-opted? Is veganism just a piece of the agenda of the world elite to sterilize us with soy and force feed us synthetic food and lab-grown meat?  

Today's video is my full speech at the Greater Reset Integration in Morelia Mexico, about the corporatization of veganism and how the vegan movement has been co-opted for profit - yet why veganism and animal liberation are still key to achieving our own freedom!

Confused about veganism? THIS video explains why veganism matters if we care about freedom and liberation!

IKm0pL1JIlI,HUGE Court Ruling,"This is HUGE. A court just appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the crimes of Ridglan Farms, one of the largest dog research and breeding facilities in the world. 

For years, I begged the government to help the Ridglan dogs. But instead of investigating Ridglan, the government tried to throw me in jail after I took a blind puppy out of her cage and to the vet. 

Now the tables have turned, with a court finding not only that animals are abused, but that the government has, de facto, been part of the cover-up. 

This is just the first step. We’ll need your help. Click the link in the bio, if you want to join our meeting this weekend to discuss what’s next.

PcOBP0_F3Sk,Wayne Hsiung Arrested for Asking a Question inside Whole Foods,"Wayne Hsiung Arrested for Asking a Question inside Whole Foods

April 24, 2018: DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung was arrested at a Boulder, Colorado Whole Foods for politely asking a question about where the meat comes from.

Wayne was released but Ateret, the camera person, was held in jail for longer. Ateret said and did nothing other than videotape the encounter, and they were charged by Whole Foods.

Call Whole Foods corporate and ask them to stop arresting teenagers for asking questions: 1-844-936-8255

You can also call the local store to make the same request: (303) 545-6611

""You should not be arresting kids for asking questions about your products. As a customer, I'm outraged. Please give your customers the right to know, instead of threatening or jailing them.""

PNpLiEVgW3k,“Does this refresh your memory as to whether eight FBI agents were involved?,"Defendant Wayne Hsiung, representing himself, cross examines the state's witness, FBI agent Chris Andersen.  Special Agent Andersen was the lead FBI agent in charge of investigating the alleged 'crime' by DxE activists.  This 'crime' in questions would refer to the 2017 investigation and piglet rescue of Smithfield's Circle Four Farms.

g_gC08phIPY,Animal Rights Activists in DxE Facing Prison for Rescuing Animals from Factory Farms w/Wayne Hsiung,"Meet Animal Rights Activists Facing Prison for Rescuing Animals from Factory Farms w/Wayne Hsiung

From Democracy Now: Nearly 100 animal rights activists were freed today, after being arrested by police in riot gear for carrying out a rescue mission and protest at the Reichardt Duck Farm in Petaluma, California, which they accuse of engaging in animal torture. More than 600 activists with Direct Action Everywhere stormed the slaughterhouse Monday, fanning out in teams to chain themselves together at the entrance, freeing dozens of ducks and in some cases locking themselves by the neck to the slaughter line. Several of the activists made it inside the slaughterhouse, where they began trying to rescue ducks that were hanging upside down by their feet. Inside the slaughterhouse, the activists began using U-locks on their own necks, locking themselves to the metal duck slaughtering production line. An employee of the slaughterhouse then turned on the belt, threatening the lives of the activists and nearly asphyxiating Thomas Chiang, who was dragged by the neck and wedged against a metal pole. Chiang was later taken away by ambulance and treated for nerve damage and severe pain. He’s since been released from the hospital. We speak with Priya Sawhney and Wayne Hsiung, co-founders and lead organizers at Direct Action Everywhere. Hsiung was arrested during Monday’s action and was released late Wednesday. He is facing a total of 17 felony charges in jurisdictions around the country for his animal rescue actions. Sawhney is also facing felony charges.

V5cI9yPZUMY,UNCAGE - TOTAL LIBERATION / ANIMAL RIGHTS VIDEO GAME,"Visit http://www.uncagegame.com for more! So today marks the 44th year that I was born to plague this universe. I dedicated the last 1,5 of those years to developing the world's first animal rights video game. And to celebrate my birthday I'm giving you a first look at this playable prototype of the game. Everything you see is to be considered a work in progress and subject to change. Thus far I have been working alone, but in the last few weeks, we are starting to assemble a team to help me make the best game possible. David, Kana, and our upcoming new members thank you so much for being part of this wondrous journey! And to everyone who feels inspired, please reach out in the comments and share your thoughts on UNCAGE.

How do you think it went?

cU2yNuDb1gk,VEGAN OUTREACH MADE EASY - Clif Grant on the Streets of Belfast,"*Please be kind to each other and about the people in my videos as many of them come to my channel to watch the videos. 🙏🏼

Hey folks. I've been really ill with a bug I picked up for about a week but I'm happy to say that I have now fully recovered and I'm back on the streets again.  This was my first day back and I'm really happy about how these conversations went. 

Let me know how you think it went in the comments!!!

If you would like to support my work I've taken the decision to start a Patreon. My reasons for doing so are on the link below...

https://www.patreon.com/ClifGrant?utm...

Ultimately I'm trying to make people stop for a moment and think - and to reconnect with the compassion for animals that already lies inside most of us.

If we take the time to inform people properly, together, one step at a time, one change at a time,  – when it all adds up, it will be one enormous result for the animals.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I also hope to talk about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

hRyejPSAe-4,Eat To Build Muscle and Lose Fat - 2 SIMPLE RULES!! (Vegan Bodybuilder Lean Bulk Diet),"I've had a few people ask for it so let's start getting into a few videos on how to diet to lose fat and build muscle. This will be particularly helpful to you if you're not getting results or a vegan athlete. 

I have a feeling this will spawn several other videos on specific types of diets so If you want more detailed information then I'll be happy to dive deeper into each specific meal plan I've followed but the principles are still the same!

Let me know what you think and what video you want next!!

UgAwJBm-3EE,"Best Raw Vegan Recipes for Beginners 🍓🌱 Easy, Healthy & Quick GO-TO Meals You Can Eat Everyday! 🌈","These are the best raw vegan recipes for beginners. 🥭 I believe that food is medicine. Consuming more fruits and vegetables has the ability to heal us physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. 🫐🥥🍊☀️🙏🏽🌿✨

🥭 MONO MEAL. Fruit is nature’s fast food.
🍉 FRUIT SALADS give you so much energy throughout the day, and they never get old.
🍓 SMOOTHIE BOWLS are quick to make and so satisfying. I can’t go a day without my smoothie bowl.
🍌 NICE CREAMS are too good to be true. It’s like eating soft-serve ice cream. It’s cruelty-free and made with only a few simple ingredients.
🥬 RAINBOW WRAPS are a great way to consume more greens.
🥑 RAINBOW SALADS are not only savory, filling, and colorful, but also provide your body with the necessary vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients it needs to thrive.
🥕 JUICING is an amazing way to hydrate & infuse your body with nutrients.

I hope this reel inspires you to start consuming just one FullyRaw meal a day. You will FEEL the difference. 🍇🍒

xhvxeDVhlwU,Building Muscle on a Vegan Diet: Expert Advice from Dr. Matthew Nagra,"Plant-based protein vs animal protein?!

In this interview with Dr. Matthew Nagra, a plant-based naturopathic doctor, we explore his journey into plant-based nutrition, sparked by personal health challenges and a desire to integrate lifestyle-based nutritional interventions with medical treatments. 

What you can expect:

- Personal Journey: Dr. Nagra discusses his transition to plant-based eating due to health issues like asthma and allergies, and how dietary changes dramatically improved his condition.

- Professional Insights: Learn about the gap between conventional medical treatments and nutritional interventions and how Dr. Nagra navigates these challenges in his practice.

- Debunking Myths: Dr. Nagra addresses common misconceptions about plant-based proteins' bioavailability and completeness, providing scientific clarity to popular dietary myths.

- Nutritional Advice: Tips on building muscle and maintaining health on a plant-based diet, especially for those with specific health concerns like diabetes.

- Challenges in Nutrition: The conversation also touches on the difficulties posed by widespread misinformation online, where anyone with a social media account might pose as a nutrition expert.

8QexeG2pbH0,What This Muslim Said About Animals Shocked Me,"In this thought-provoking street debate, a Muslim discusses halal slaughter, survival vs. pleasure, and whether a peaceful god would support animal agriculture.

Key Topics Discussed:

✅ Why is halal slaughter required in Islam?
✅ Does the method of killing matter if animals don’t want to die?
✅ Is eating meat necessary for survival, or is it just taste preference?
✅ How would a peaceful god view factory farming today?

-eKCLlHMYKk,FBI Raids Animal Shelters Searching for Rescued Piglets with Wayne Hsiung and DxE,"FBI Raids Animal Shelters Searching for Rescued Piglets with Wayne Hsiung and DxE
Last week, FBI agents in bulletproof vests descended on two shelters for abandoned farm animals -- Ching Farm Rescue in Herriman, Utah and Luvin Arms in Erie, Colorado -- with search warrants, demanding DNA samples for piglets the agents said were named “Lucy” and “Ethel.” Activists with the animal rights network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), who recently rescued two dying piglets from a Smithfield farm in Utah in an investigation featured in The New York Times, say the FBI’s raids are intended to intimidate activists who are engaged in rescue and whistleblowing efforts. 

“Piglets were rotting to death in piles of their own mother’s feces at Smithfield,” DxE co-founder and former Northwestern law professor Wayne Hsiung said. “Rescuing them was an act of compassion, not a crime. But Smithfield doesn’t want the public to see the horrifying truth of how they produce their pork.” 


DxE activists say the actions by the FBI are an indication of the close ties between large agricultural corporations and the government that led to the passage of unconstitutional “ag gag” laws across the nation, which criminalize taking photographs at factory farms. Smithfield, with major operations in ag-gag states such as Utah and North Carolina, was a major beneficiary of those laws. With growing concern over abuse and consumer fraud in the meat industry, the activists say that producers are using illegitimate means to repress nonviolent activism. 


“We have people drowning in Houston, some of the worst wildfires in our nation’s history, a president tweeting about nuclear war, and federal prosecutors are concerned about a piglet caper,” University of Denver constitutional law scholar Justin Marceau, one of the lead counsels in the recent constitutional challenge to the Utah ag-gag law, said. “This isn’t about piglets rescued from a dead pile. This is about a systematic crackdown on direct action of the sort celebrated by civil rights leaders. It is disgusting, and I look forward to hearing about the prosecution’s decision to prioritize a case against persons accused of rescuing pigs.”

The DxE activists say the FBI’s targeting of animal sanctuaries, who had no involvement in or knowledge of the Smithfield investigation, is a dramatic example of overreaching by the federal government. Federal agents even followed shelter volunteers back to their homes, dramatically confronting them in front of their families and neighbors. 


“We are quite open about the fact that we are documenting abuses and rescuing injured animals,” Hsiung said. “The government doesn’t need to waste resources chasing piglets around the country, scaring senior citizens and families, when they can find all the details about our rescue on YouTube.” 


Hsiung says that activists are planning to hold a vigil at Smithfield’s Milford, Utah facility in response to the raids. Activists are also planning demonstrations at FBI and Department of Justice offices around the nation, asking the federal government to end surveillance and intimidation tactics of nonviolent animal advocates, including animal shelter volunteers.

r3WWtBUEi5U,Vegan vs Meat HEATED Oxford University 2024 Debate,"Debate: Would Oxford Union Go Vegan?

Back in December 2023, a debate expressed its support for veganism, with a majority of Oxford Union members agreeing with the motion “This House Would Go Vegan.”

During the debate, Joey Carbstrong set out the ethical case for veganism. In the closing speech for the proposition, he outlined the harms that “speciesism” causes animals and wider society.

With more than 150,000 subscribers on YouTube, @JoeyCarbstrong is well known for his street interviews about veganism. Earlier this year, he released the first ever UK footage of pigs being gassed to death in a slaughterhouse. At the Oxford Union, Carbstrong talked about the “crimes” that humans commit against animals.

On the opposite benches was polemical media figure and far-right commentator Katie Hopkins. 

Her appearance had already caused backlash ahead of the debate. The Oxford Students’ Union condemned her invitation to speak in the famous chamber. In a statement on social media, they condemned her for “denigrating Islam, blaming crime on multiculturalism, and expressing discriminatory views against various ethnic and social groups.”

fwpKESYJj7g,Joey Carbstrong OWNING People,"This video demonstrates why Joey is my favorite activists for the animals. His no BS approach and drive to speak up for the animals the way the victims would want to be spoken up for fills me pride. It was his inspiration that made me become an activist and for that I'll be eternally grateful to you @JoeyCarbstrong 

This is also the first video to include my new outro/intro with my name.

rLp4MBWor0s,UnchainedTV Wednesday Coverage of the #SmithfieldTrial of Wayne Hsiung & Paul Picklesimer in Utah.,"Live on October 5th 2022: #UnchainedTV is LIVE at the courthouse for the #SmithfieldTrial with EXPERT COVERAGE of the ongoing Utah TRIAL of Direct Action Everywhere co-founder Wayne Hsiung and #DxE member Paul Picklesimer. These two men face over a DECADE in prison for removing 2 piglets they said were very sick as they videotaped themselves inside a massive Utah pig factory farm, described this way by the New York Times: “The film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.” 
Our team coverage includes commentary by famed former prosecutor Bonnie Klapper,  Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, TheirTurn Founder Donny Moss, trial watcher Mick Davoudian and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah and DxE Organizer Carla Cabral to find out what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In today's video, I am talking about ex-vegans. However, rather than focussing on this issue from the perspective of influencers making videos announcing they're no longer vegan, I wanted to approach this conversation by talking about everyday people who stop being vegan.

To do this, I focus on two types of vegans. The first being the vegan who dives headfirst into the community and becomes completely immersed in veganism, and the second being the person who goes vegan on their own with no support from their family or social circles.

4dCjjO3-RGc,ANGRY DAIRY FARMERS TRY TO TAKE MY CAMERA - My Craziest Vegan Outreach Ever!!!,"*Please be kind to each other and about the people in my videos as many of them come to my channel to watch the videos. 🙏🏼

These farmers came for an argument. They tell us that they care for and love their animals...  but some of the things they say about both animals and humans are absolutely disgusting. It makes me so sad that they have animals in their care.

They eventually threw a hissy fit and left.... but they'd noticed that I was filming and came back a few minutes later and tried to swipe my camera. Luckily I have it strapped down!!

As soon as they left, a young lady who was watching from the side (Cara) came to have a conversation with me and she turned out to be an amazing human being.

Good people and people who do bad things surround us! We just have to find the good and tell them the truth without fear, anger or judgement. That's how we will change this cruel world! 

If you would like to support my work I've taken the decision to start a Patreon. My reasons for doing so are on the link below...

https://www.patreon.com/ClifGrant?utm...

Ultimately I'm trying to make people stop for a moment and think - and to reconnect with the compassion for animals that already lies inside most of us.

If we take the time to inform people properly, together, one step at a time, one change at a time,  – when it all adds up, it will be one enormous result for the animals.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I also hope to talk about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

Please support my activism, if you can, on Ko-Fi:

~

Like most interactions, I really enjoyed this one. They were friendly, thoughtful and evidently compassionate. 

I think, given their previous exposure to the topic and love for animals, I could have done more to hold them accountable to themselves, or at least been firmer in my encouragement to fiercely pursue the truth, through the resources given.

But, hey - I'm convinced that leaving them with a smile is more EMPOWERING than potentially leaving them with a frown.

Thanks for watching!

F9U1ifVezMA,The Human is Vegan: An Ethical Argument  by Gary Yourofsky,"This talk, given at Lonestar College - Cy-Fair on Oct 17th, 2013 features Gary Yourofsky (www.adappt.org) an animal right activist and lecturer.  Gary has given over 2,000 talks concerning animal rights in over 170 schools in America.

Mr. Yourofsky was invited to multiple philosophy classes in order to present a rational argument that students could evaluate and react to through a process of question and answer.  Mr. Yourofsky did so with his own budget and his arguments should be seen as his solely.  

It is up to the person hearing the argument to evaluate the accuracy of the claims made and decide whether they indeed have ethical ramifications for their lives.  

it is encouraged that you, the viewer, do the same.

mNaeIjsQ2QE,History of Animal Rights | Moby's Veganniversary,"I went vegan 34 years ago, so this week is my 34 year veganniversary. To that end i’m going to be posting a different piece of vegan related content every day for the next 7 days.

Here we have a cursory history of animal rights, in VERY FANCY CARTOON FORM. I wanted the cartoon to feel a bit like the cartoons i watched when i was in elementary school.. And here are two of my favorite quotes;

‘The time will come when men will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of man.""-Leonardo Da Vinci, and “I am in favor of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the way of a whole human being.”-Abraham Lincoln. And don’t forget, tomorrow Tuesday 11 a.m pst the art/animals/activism livestream on twitch!

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In today's video, I sit down to debate veganism with two students at Boston University. Throughout the debate the students continuously push back against my arguments and even though morally they find themselves agreeing with me, they still question what the point of going vegan would even be.

This was a 10 minute conversation that went amazingly well for the entire 10 minutes. We spent 90% of the time talking about the mentality behind why humans exploit animals. There were a few times we spoke about what was being shown. He didn't know about the male chicks being killed upon hatching. That really affected him. The footage helps in tugging at the heart and showing the truth but the area to focus on and what brings it all home is the mind. The animals are rooting and waiting for your Tunde. And so am I.

fCWpW-5GLbU,Vegan Gains vs Vegetable Police. Someone filmed our fight.,"Sorry for attacking you bro, it was just a misunderstanding!

Support me by BUYING my MUSIC please ;) Thanks! https://vegetablepolice.bandcamp.com/

It definitely didn't go the way I planned... He's stronger than he looks.

After Vegan Gains gets out of the hospital following my viscous attack on him, I'd like to chill with him someday ;)  He's misunderstood, and from what I've seen, he's a genuinely good human being.  

I thought this would be a hilarious video.  Walking up to Vegan Gains, who clearly is very strong and obviously gets enough protein, and yelling ""Where do you get your protein bitch!!?""  I love the final result, and I really just want to make people laugh ;)  Bring awareness to plant based diets through humour.  That's what I'm here to do ;)

nEklIXnpb5c,What I eat in a day as a vegan (during a fat loss phase),"This was filmed before my ACL surgery but a great example of eating in a fat loss phase…

Keeping my meals simple and consistent has made it super easy to get back into a deficit and feel satisfied even while reducing calories after my bulk phase. I do 3 things every day:

1️⃣ Eat a filling breakfast like oats - this reduces nighttime cravings.

2️⃣ Eat a ton of potatoes and veg - low calorie dense and super satiating.

3️⃣ Cook without oil - I sauté with water, saving myself 100s of calories daily. (I don’t add it to my stir fry either). This is the EASIEST way to reduce calories without affecting how full you feel.

Do you do these 3 things each day?",Chelsea Mae,0,2,6,11,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53726033856506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18921091733336137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22806403312288298,0.5220030934009148,0.0,0.17611818797039866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.452170578540633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634389978170062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260852892703165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06268909979731052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18389532116236923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.656822318437882,16.414357536324538,11.798111925972618,6.003887067106539,4.0943445622221,6.073177943751326,8.706587691173612,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
z4F-5VROXvg,How To Do Short-Style Vegan Outreach (See Description),"#howto #vegan #outreach 

I define short-style outreach as conversations under 10 minutes. This is a good style to employ if you want to interact with more people in one outing.  

This style of outreach has 4 steps. 

Step one - introduce yourself and what you're doing
Step two - break the ice / try to understand who you're interviewing
Step three - spark interest (controversy)
Step four - conclude with a meaningful question 

It may be beneficial to end with a more explicit accountability question like, ""What can you do to prevent animals from being harmed in [insert specific scenario]?"", especially if you show a quick clip of the industry on a tablet or phone. 

While I don't think this was my best outreach conversation (warming up after some time away from street outreach), I think I still accomplished my goal which was to listen to what Mark had to say and introduce veganism to him as a way to treat animals with fairness. 

I feel like I could have improved this interaction by showing a video under three minutes and asking an accountability question at the end. 

I will attempt to follow up with Mark to see if he has gone vegan or reduced his consumption of animal products, as well as to send him some recipes. 

I would be thrilled if anyone who hasn't attempted outreach yet gave it a try because of this video. Best of luck!

_mzeVCD18NE,Vegan Gets Attacked By Slaughter Worker - Live Interview,"This vegan gets attacked by a slaughter worker while investigating a slaughterhouse. His friend who is also a vegan gets assaulted by a worker as they steal his phone for trying to film. In the clip you can see the vegan gets angry, was this the right response?

If a vegan gets attacked, should that vegan get angry? If a vegan gets mad, is that a good or bad thing for raising awareness?

Bobby Lynch is the vegan who gets attacked in the clip, he joins today's livestream to discuss what happened and discuss the question: If a vegan gets attacked, what should they do?

-oPazX8UUU4,Behind The Mask - Animal Liberation Front  | Full movie,"*Uploaded for educational purposes*

""Behind the Mask, a production of Uncaged Films and ARME directed and produced by Shannon Keith, is an outstanding and thought provoking documentary about the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Winner of numerous awards, the seventy-two minute investigative film weaves together interviews with some of the leading figures in the animal liberation movement with undercover footage of animals in laboratories, as well as being liberated and in loving sanctuaries. 

The films subtitle: “The story of the people who risk everything to save animals,” is nothing but the truth. For more than thirty years the organization has been freeing nonhuman animals around the world and destroying property that causes harm to those animals totaling up in the hundreds of millions of dollars of “damage.” As the film explains, the ALF has been identified by the FBI as the number one domestic threat in the U.S. despite the fact that they are against harming any living creature human or nonhuman, and have not harmed anyone since becoming established in the mid-1970s.""

LiAy47Ic_Nw,Vegan Outreach Part 10,"Activist Support/Advice Weekly Reminder 

I'm about 95% sure I've outreached this individual in the past. He looked so familiar and his definition of veganism was a little too on point as well. I think a lot of it was weighing on him in this conversation. Most of the conversation he was just staring at the screen not saying anything. The whole time he looked as if he was getting very emotional. Guilt? Shame? Disappointed? I'm not sure.  When he took the information I gave him, he was very serious about watching everything. The animals hope he sticks to it this time around.

Don't miss out on opportunities to educate yourself to remove your supremacist mentality for other animals by going vegan. You too will live to regret not changing sooner. We all do 

Side bar: Outreach these days are night and day. Even at work it's all different. Once you become informed about what vegansim means, you know how to speak about it in a more effective and educated manner. There's no room for the usual morally bankrupt excuses people usually give. Very seldom if ever are they brought up. Leslie Cross' articles, Vegansim Defined, The Vegan Story and, The Surge of Freedom and most importantly listening and accepting feedback is what will ultimately help excel your advocacy which will ultimately propel animals even faster to their emancipated states.

ijwLDet8Auo,Animal Liberation Front (ALF) Tribute,"The Animal Liberation Front (A.L.F.) is an international, leaderless, decentralized political and social resistance movement that engages in and promotes non-violent direct action in protest against incidents of animal cruelty. Started in England in mid 70s by hunt saboteurs and spreading the world ever since. This is my tribute video to the movement.

Lyrics:

It's getting late but I'm sleepless, 
going out of my mind.
Constantly feeling the pressure
no I don't see you, I'm blind.

Bridge:
We need an expedition, 
to cure all their bad mistakes.

I try to dismiss my problems,
somehow I'm stuck with them.
Story of a life that was taken, 
you work and then you die.

Chorus:
Government's fault, 
they try to kill your essence.
People will raise 'cause they, 
have lost their patience.

Whatever may happen tomorrow, 
something will change with time.
Possible in the near future,
we will go over the line.

Bridge:
We need an expedition, 
to cure all their bad mistakes.

Maybe it matters to someone,
that you're not fighting alone.
That we're feeling your anger,
and listening to your tone.

Chorus:
Government's fault, 
they try to kill your essence.
People will raise 'cause they, 
have lost their patience.
And when we'll march,
towards the sun to find the ending story.
We won't apologize no more,
for taking our glory.",Clade,0,7,4,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,11,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20472617398724016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19602441741074436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20621910889031234,0.0,0.16861681424159974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15919440787673286,0.0,0.18529870065453696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094467778664371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32740806324470173,0.0,0.18192423141127964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20724692559020522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.334192701515621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33319746228073993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4026997186419108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712482537742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35377690334565876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251222562753324,0.0,0.08307515283157794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2180185971628377,10.953067147626927,4.394449154672439,3.5553480614894135,5.1647859739235145,16.873337742073076,10.458643063511968,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
RaJcbHCR2CQ,BUSTED BY HIDDEN CAMERAS: The Biggest Turkey Farm Investigation I’ve EVER Done (2023),"This investigation took place between the 19th November and 14th December 2023 at the Avara Foods run Sandybank Farm, Thirsk, England. Avara Foods supplies major UK supermarkets like @sainsburys  , @Asda  and @tesco  On Avara’s website it states “We are committed to protecting the health and wellbeing of the animals in our care.” The farm is also assured by @redtractoruk   who claim their “food is farmed with care” but our latest investigation shows the complete opposite. Please send a complaint to enquiries@redtractor.org.uk  along with a link to this full investigation and ask them why they assure disgusting hell holes like Sandybank farm?

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In today's video I sit down with Sahil at the University of Texas at Austin. Sahil argues his stance as a vegetarian and states that there isn't a strong argument to change to veganism. He also challenges me on pushing the morals of veganism on others.

swg3KPFcIUI,How to Win Rights for Animals with Activist Wayne Hsiung,"3.5 percent. That’s the tipping point for change. Wayne Hsiung is an expert in social movement, and he’s a massive proponent of getting the animal rights movement to that crucial number. Wayne started out as a corporate attorney and swiftly realized that more was needed to move the needle. The world needs a political shift. He co-founded Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) to change the system and inspire other activists to continue his work. Wayne is known for staging open rescues and documenting atrocious slaughterhouses and feedlots, and his footage has been captured by the mainstream media and garnered hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. If you’re passionate about social change—whether it has to do with animal or human rights—Wayne’s knowledge will hit home.

_QmpdXaZyqw,"DxE's Wayne Hsiung Responds to ""VICE - Animal Rights Extremists: Trespassing to Rescue Chickens""","DxE's Wayne Hsiung and Cassie King Respond to ""VICE - Animal Rights Extremists: Trespassing to Rescue Chickens"" 

FYI, this documentary was previously named ""Animal Rights Extremists: Terrorism vs. Protest"", but the name has recently been changed, we believe in the first half of 2020.

Did VICE cover-up the cruelty at a major Amazon farm?

Cassie and Wayne are discussing what VICE got wrong (and right) in its recent documentary about DxE... and the insidious problem at the root of all corporate media.

Nutritional inputs for Cronometer:

Breakfast:
- 1 black coffee
- 1 ½ cup steel cut oats (cooked)
- 20g ground flaxseeds
- ¾ cup frozen blueberries
- 2 scoops Fyta protein

Matcha latte:
- 2 cups barista blend soy milk
- 10g matcha

Lunch:
- 2 slices of Silver Hills Big 16 bread
- 2 Tbsp Hellman’s vegan mayo (I also rotate through hummus and BBQ)
- ½ avocado
- 170g sriracha tofu
- 1 roma tomato
- 2 kale leaves
- Note: Not all of the avocado, tomato, and tofu fit in the sandwich, so I ate the rest on the side.

Snack: 1 apple

Dinner: I made double this and split fairly evenly over 2 nights
- 2 ½ cups GoGoQuinoa protein (pea-based) penne pasta
- ~200ml tomato sauce (no salt added)
- Herbs and spices to taste
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 200g broccoli
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- ½ cup mushrooms
- ¼ cup spinach (cooked)
- 3 Tbsp nutritional yeast

Oh, and a B12 and D3 supplement, so I set targets for those 2 to zero in Cronometer.

Today's video:

Non-vegans presume that the hardest part of going vegan is finding food or getting enough vitamin B12 and yet, in my experience and the experience of many vegans that come and speak to me, these are far from the hardest part of being vegan. So in today’s video, I thought I would sit down and chat about my experience as a vegan and what I genuinely struggle with. I’d love to know in the comments if you agree with what I say and for you to share your own experiences too.

XZFpQcxsoL4,How to Start Vegan Conversations + Speech Clips,"Everyone vegans wants to share the vegan love. There's even a joke about us, ""How do you know when someone's vegan? Don't worry they'll tell you!"" I love that joke! It's true! We want everyone to feels as good as we feel and we want animals to live in peace and not be abused and killed.

Today's video:

Today's video is of a live radio debate I had on the BBC for a programme called #MoralMaze. In the debate I was asked a variety of different questions by two meat eating panelists. However, the debate became particularly heated when one of the panelists attempted to call me out for using the phrase gas chambers.

oe4K6za49-0,Dua Lipa eats a pigeon.,"It’s such a shame to see Dua Lipa promoting such unethical and cruel food in a Vogue video. It’s also strange how people will sometimes proclaim they’ll eat anything, as if that’s something admirable or praiseworthy. But viewing animals as being disposable and lacking empathy towards them is not a good thing, it’s immoral and wrong.

And this doesn’t just apply to the foie gras Dua is eating, even though her eating and promoting foie gras speaks volumes about how little she thinks of animals. It’s time for us to stop force feeding animals and it’s also time for us to stop mutilating, forcibly impregnating and slaughtering animals too.

Uj_4IAcrihk,CAN ANIMAL ABUSE EVER BE JUSTIFIED - Vegan Outreach,"*Please be kind to each other and about the people in my videos as many of them come to my channel to watch the videos. 🙏🏼

Hey everyone.  I've found that a lot of men in this age bracket just aren't prepared to listen....   but this guy was actually really open to listening. 

Let me know how you think it went in the comments!!!

If you would like to support my work I've taken the decision to start a Patreon. My reasons for doing so are on the link below...

https://www.patreon.com/ClifGrant?utm...

Ultimately I'm trying to make people stop for a moment and think - and to reconnect with the compassion for animals that already lies inside most of us.

If we take the time to inform people properly, together, one step at a time, one change at a time,  – when it all adds up, it will be one enormous result for the animals.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I also hope to talk about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

zOlN6d1CP9A,"Peter Singer: Animal Liberation, Forty Years On","Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation, often credited with starting the modern animal rights movement, was first published in September 1975. In this lecture, the author assesses how well the argument has stood up over that period, and what progress has been made towards the changes in our treatment of animals that the book advocates.

Immerse yourself in the world of animal rights protests, campaigns, demonstrations, outreach, rescue, and so much more.

In today’s world, voices of the marginalized are in the spotlight and people across the globe are recognizing animal rights as a social justice movement. During a time of historic actions and victorious campaigns, Voices for Animal Liberation depicts the full spectrum of animal rights activism that is currently at work to create change.

This book offers the words of both new and highly influential voices in the movement today, with the intention of inspiring and educating those who are sparked by the vision of a more ethical world.

Connect with activists from different backgrounds as they reveal their perspectives on animal rights, their experiences taking action for animals, the challenges they've faced, and the meaning of activism in their lives.

0VHK8wpFci4,The breakfast that helped me lose 40lbs as a vegan,"Maybe if I post this meal 50x people will realise I do truly eat the same thing each day. 🤓

Cool story:
I finished a bulk in April and since then I’ve lost 9lbs of the fat I gained.
It’s been very easy because I decided to just eat the same breakfast and lunch each day and make my habits solid as a rock.

The only difference now to when I started my weight loss journey is I do use protein powder, but the calories are the same because I used to add banana or a sweetener.

This is a perfect meal for fat loss as it’s filling and low calorie. I use quick oats as they cook faster and I’m lazy and impatient.

""Nancy: I'm Nancy Grace. This is ""America's Most Wanted Overtime."" 

Tonight a female believed to be a homegrown terrorist who put first responders' lives in danger across the country, Josephine Sunshine Overaker, wanted for a string of arsons causing tens of millions of dollars of damage. 

Special guest joining us, Peter Young. Hold on to your seat: Convicted ecoterrorist, former fugitive on the run nearly a decade, and you can find him at peteryoung.me or on Amazon at ""Liberate"" his new book. 

Peter, you were, as they say, a politically motivated fugitive, AKA a criminal, much like Overaker. But what is different about the psyche of politically motivated fugitives?

Peter: What's different about criminals like Ms. Overaker or myself are that we're motivated simply by compassion. It's actually the opposite of what motivates most criminals. We are motivated by desire to save animals from horrific situations, such as slaughterhouses and labs, and because the extremity of what happens to these animals on laboratories and factory farms is so extreme, that we are forced to take extreme actions in order to save them.

Nancy: Can I ask you, sir, were you ever concerned about a first responder rushing into a burning structure that you had created and losing their life?

Peter: I never engaged in the act of arson. Let's just be clear about that. All I did was free animals from farms. However, arson, it's against the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) credo to ever put lives at risk. The ALF only sets fire to empty buildings and equipment like trucks. So there's never any risk of lives at risk.

Nancy: Peter, you and I, I assume we'll have to agree to disagree. I support your cause of saving animals, but I do not support arson where firefighters that I have worked with my entire career in public service can rush into a burning building and risk their lives. But hey, that's just me. 

Let me ask you about how you were able to avoid capture for seven years.

Peter: I was facing a life sentence for freeing mink and foxes from fur farms, literally 82 years in federal prison.

There's really only two rules of being a successful fugitive. Number one is to have a real ID under a fake name, which I accomplished, and #2, don't call your parents. If you could do those two things, the rest is just simply a matter of not getting arrested. So ultimately I was arrested for a petty offense and I had my fingerprints ran and that's how I was caught.

Nancy: Peter, you said you were caught on a petty offense and fingerprinted. What was the offense?

Peter: Shoplifting.

Nancy: Having been in similar shoes to Overaker, what do you think it will take for her to finally either get caught or surrender?

Peter: You have to understand the people that are surrounding her - and this is speculation -but I can speak to my situation. The people surrounding me, I had a $100,000 price tag on my head from the Fur Commission USA Trade Group. And the people around me knew that, and they still didn't turn me in despite that massive financial incentive. And the reason for that was because I was surrounded by people that shared my belief that animals are not here for us to kill, murder, and that sometimes we have to work outside the law to save those animals. 

I would have to imagine that financial motivation is not going to be what it's going to take to get people that are surrounding an animal rights fugitive to turn her in.

Nancy: You just heard Peter Young. He supports her to the hilt. 

Peter Young, so devoted to animal rights. Peter, I'm just as devoted to victims' rights and I have worked with so many fire people that risk their lives going into burning warehouses, maybe they were empty, but those firefighters go in and risk everything. That's my concern tonight. 

Peter. I want to thank you for being with us, Peter, convicted ecoterrorist, former fugitive for nearly a decade, author of ""Liberate"" on Amazon. You can find him at peteryoung.me. Peter, thank you for being with us.""

In today's video, I have a really heartwarming conversation with Xavier, a student at UC Irvine. It can often feel really frustrating talking about veganism with people who are not yet #vegan. However, talking to people like Xavier fills me with optimism and hope for the future. Here's hoping he made those changes!

Today's video:

It's not breaking news to say that both #JoeRogan and #ElonMusk have a shockingly poor understanding of the realities of animal farming and veganism. However, even by their standards, their latest conversation is astonishing. It's actually impressive how demonstrably wrong they both are and how much misinformation they are able to spread in only a couple of minutes.

cNcp4mJcYTY,Lab-grown meat has been DEBUNKED! 🥩,"This farmer’s rebuke of cell cultured meat is exceptionally ironic considering the chickens we slaughter for meat have been selectively bred to grow to slaughter weight in about five weeks.

This incredibly fast rate of growth means that the bird's young bones are unable to support them, breaking under the weight and strain of their disfigured bodies - resulting in painful lameness which prevents them from eating, drinking or even standing up. Many die from dehydration or starvation because they are unable to access food and water points. Organ failure is also extremely common, with millions of birds dying from heart and lung failure before they even reach the age of slaughter.

So perhaps the real question we should be asking is, how can we ethically justify eating animals that grow so fast that their organs fail, they cannot stand up and they live in constant suffering?

Sadly, this farmer is using her lack understanding about cell-cultured meat as a reason for deciding that it must be bad. However, not understanding how something works is not a valid criticism in and of itself of that thing. So just because this farmer doesn’t understand how cell-cultured meat is created, does not therefore mean cell cultured meat is bad, especially as you can literally research how it works.

What is bad though, is needlessly causing suffering to tens of billions of animals and then slaughtering them.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

I couldn’t quite believe what I was hearing when Martin Kennedy, the Director of the National Farmers’ Union of Scotland, blatantly lied on television, stating that the standard practices I had just described didn’t happen in the UK. It’s hardly surprising that he would feel the need to lie, considering that what we do to animals is so horrific, a point made by the presenter. Interestingly, after I called Martin out for lying, he then backtracked on his statement, claiming that he didn’t actually say what he had said and that instead he had said that what happens to animals is not brutal and is done in their best interest. A slight 180 from him agreeing that what happens to animals is horrific. 

Unfortunately, lying is something that animal farmers are used to doing. In fact, Martin made many outlandish claims that were simply untrue throughout the whole segment. The problem animal farmers find themselves in is that the truth is not what they want it to be, and if they were to accept the truth they would then need to acknowledge the harm and damage their industries cause and then change as a result. So instead, it’s easier for them to ignore the reality of what they do and then lie in the hope that they can spread enough disinformation to confuse and gaslight consumers.

y7HHbd0P4yo,Vegan called out on live TV! #veganism,"Just when you think you’ve heard it all.

Some of you may remember Mike Parry from a TV segment where he referred to himself as a ‘sausage expert’ and yet ate a vegan sausage sandwich believing it to be meat. He called the vegan sausages ‘luscious and lovely’ before being told that they were vegan sausages. 

One of the many great things about a plant-based diet is that you can choose whether or not to eat a plant-based alternative. However, the reason plant-based alternatives exist is so that people can have the choice to eat a product that is similar to an animal product but is more ethical. Plus, as research shows, including a review of 43 studies, they are also more sustainable and healthier than their animal counterparts too. 

Study: Plant-based animal product alternatives are healthier and more environmentally sustainable than animal products. Future Foods, 2022.

GLs-L-1s8cg,Animal Liberation: How Do We Get There? ~Dr. Steve Best,"""Have you ever wondered why is it so hard to convince someone to go vegan?
We dont need to tell you how morally initiatory and how nutritiously simple veganism is. So how come it is so hard, even for many people who define themselves as ""animal lovers"", to become vegans? It is a question we have constantly asked ourselves when we were ""vegan converters"". Could it be that the obstacle to veganism is the messengers? Not enough health food stores? The price of soy milk? Not enough vegan celebrities? Not enough visual evidence about what is going on in factory farms? You know it is not any of these.""

""It is a rather banal and self evident idea that many activists think of at some point in their lives, but we feel that mostly it pops up in times of despair and disbelief while it should be the primal concept at all times regardless of the state of affairs within the animal rights movement or with your own activism.""

What exploited nonhumans need to be liberated is very simple: they need humans to be extinct.
This may be a daunting technical task but it is still a technical task.
What is IMPOSSIBLE is to liberate these nonhumans and keep humans alive.

tdBtlepMi4k,Why Pregnant Women Should Be Vegan,"There are so many reasons to adopt a whole food vegan diet before, during, and after pregnancy!

👭 MOMMY SOLIDARITY
Dairy cows are exploited as mothers 
• they are forcefully impregnated, and their young are most often stolen from them at birth -- cows can only produce milk after having a baby, and dairy farmers keep them pregnant in order to keep the milk coming. 
• of course, the calves are the ones who are supposed to drink the milk, so they have to be separated from their mothers at birth so as to not drink the profit. males often end up in the cruel veal industry, while females suffer the same fate as their mothers.
• Once a female cow is “spent”, or no longer able to produce milk she will most likely end up in a slaughter house. 20% of beef in the US comes from dairy cows https://www.agweb.com/article/dairy-cattle-beef-up-beef-industry-wyatt-bechtel/#.Vqlk9-qOQZc.facebook (beef industry website)

8WSrRV5ovPE,EVERY Vegan Needs to Hear This! Are You Advocating Cruelty? [SPEECH],"Are you advocating cruelty in your vegan activism and outreach? It can feel easier to offer things like ""Meatless Mondays"" or ""humane"" alternatives than ask people to go ""fully"" vegan. But when we take this approach, we're not only doing a disservice to the animals, but also to non-vegans themselves. We're deciding FOR them that they can't handle the full truth. We're deciding FOR them that they can't, or won't, make the decision to go vegan. 

In this speech, I address how to ensure we as activists avoid advocating the very things we are fighting against. In addition to covering examples of what NOT to say in our activism, I also touch on some approaches of what TO say—and HOW to say it, as well as ways to remove common barriers that arise when speaking with non-vegans.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In today’s video I look at an article that addresses the Eric Adams 'Fishgate' situation by advocating for the rules of veganism to become loosened so that veganism is less strict. I analyse the author’s arguments and provide my own commentary on whether or not I agree with the proposed idea.

4tqq9aehD0U,Wayne Hsiung & Democracy Now: Protesters Punished While Letting Corporations Off for Animal Torture,"Wayne Hsiung & Democracy Now: Cops Punish Protesters While Letting Corporations Off for Animal Torture

JUNE 07, 2019 - Following the release of nearly 100 animal rights activists who were arrested for carrying out a rescue mission and protest at a Northern California duck farm this week, we speak with the founders of the group that coordinated the protest, Direct Action Everywhere. Priya Sawhney and Wayne Hsiung are both facing years of jail time for conducting a series of actions protesting animal torture in recent years. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Bonnie Klapper writes, “When law enforcement has become aware of the existence of animal cruelty, its response has not been to address [it]. To the contrary, the response has been to hunt down and arrest the rescuers and even attempt to return the injured, sick, dying animals to the agricultural facility.”

Z5mBm7Mo1Xs,The End of Dog Meat,"Bans on dog meat are suddenly sweeping across Asia, and there’s a simple reason why: people are realizing they’d rather play with dogs than eat them.

This includes pop star Taeyeon, whose dog Zero has become a star in his own right.

But what’s true for dogs is true for other animals, too. A cow loves to play as much as a puppy. Isn’t it time we give all the animals the lives they deserve?

VYTNjmwu5MA,Animal Liberation Song,"Das Lied der internationalen Tierrechtsbewegung. Wir hören von den Tieren selbst wie sehr sie leiden und uns Menschen darum bitten, ihnen zu helfen.
Lea (Stimme) und Linda(Gitarre) interpretieren dieses Lied auf eine sehr einfühlsame Weise.


I'm in pain
Living in misery
Won't you do something about it?
Please do something about it!

You say I'm different
So you treat me lesser than
But you are so wrong about me
Yes, you are so wrong about me

Because I'm like you
I feel pain, love, too
I'm you but in a different body
Yet there's still life inside my body

Let me be free
Freedom from your tyranny
It's all I've ever wanted
It's all I've ever wanted

Liberation
For the animals
Liberation
Because we are all animals
We're all animals!",Quelle des Mitgefühls,0,9,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12146768056207695,0.442950933114326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13825853852499864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23783225758139137,0.5827710829315026,0.0,0.21587776489140037,0.0,0.21137604579584554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23260954720816068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4778578120595618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.7145836777675496,8.019612794400267,4.543294782270004,2.5649493574615367,5.3981627015177525,11.778338119247355,9.045041696510276,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Vwvuk3Zit6g,"Animal Liberation Toronto Conference promo video - ""final edition""","I was at the Liberation TO Video Production Workshop earlier this year with Vegan AF Productions. Decided to put this short video together to exercise a bit of what we learned  =)  I hope you like the video!  And attend the conference!  Register now at www.LiberationTO.com/register  See you soon!

_____
From another video earlier this year: 

""I attended a video editing workshop a couple of weeks ago. During the workshop, we started editing a video to promote the Animal Liberation Toronto Conference 2019 (the first Animal Rights conference to happen in Toronto). I never got to share the little bit of footage I got with those putting their video together, so I thought I would exercise what I learned by creating my own short demo. Here is the result so far 🐾 I’m thinking I should add a few more subtitles to promote the trainings and workshops that will be offered at the conference and/or a story line sharing my experience about this pre-conference workshop and/or a call to action and an invitation for people to attend the conference, referring on how to sign up, upcoming events... things like that.  Stay tuned!""

VzgMj3peKL0,A Plant-based Diet Changed My Life | Pat McAuley | TEDxBabsonCollege,"NOTE FROM TED: While some viewers may find the nutrition advice provided in this talk to be helpful, please do not look to this talk for medical advice. We've flagged this talk, which was filmed at a TEDx event, because it appears to fall outside TEDx's content guidelines. This talk contains strong assertions about a specific diet that lack sufficient scientific evidence for general prescription. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf


Pat McAuley describes the impact that food has on his life and why he is an advocate of the health and environmental benefits of plant-based living. Pat McAuley is a Boston-based serial entrepreneur, author, speaker, and startup consultant for ethical/plant-based companies. He has started and successfully run companies in the tech space and food and beverage industries and has extensive experience building brands from scratch. After a plant-based diet changed his life, Pat shifted his focus to building and supporting businesses in the plant-based space. He is now an outspoken advocate of the health and environmental benefits of plant-based living.

The lyrics of the poem are here:

Once upon a time
In a not so distant land
She opened her eyes
And realized she cannot stand
Tied to the pole
All her life
Beaten, raped, and assaulted
Waiting for that God damn knife
She wasn’t my sister, best friend or my mother
She was a living being
With a heart, a brain and beat
Just like any other
The last thing that she saw
Was a knife held by a man
Oh let me tell you where it all began
It’s the very thing you are holding in your hand
Espresso, muffins and choco latte
It all comes from nothing but animal cruelty
The milk in your food
Was stolen from the calf
Mixed with artificial hormones
That you are drinking on their behalf
Slaughtered and hung upside down
They watch their friends being killed until the dawn
You buy the final product and you pay your hard earned money of course
The cow’s pain and sufferings are not important factors of the economy
They say,
“You can’t survive on plants”
“Meat gives you Protein”
Oh but the horrors in the slaughter houses, once witnessed cannot be unseen
Once upon a time
In this very land
There was a cow
Whose dead body was sold by this very brand
What now one must wonder?
I’ll tell you how to put an end to this mass murder
Research, learn, raise your voice and break the silence
That’s the only way to end this violence",Animal Save Movement,0,17,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,22,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14870954653073704,0.0,0.0,0.36354171787988077,0.08838078980665263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126094282932286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10529392528855386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15447574982338946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720717314647394,0.0,0.0,0.22254519536011,0.10454520794133416,0.14236206221819195,0.23255744478890522,0.0,0.12922050233861285,0.0,0.2530517103864722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720717314647394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985952526811418,0.1012292995161196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17814953057203245,0.0,0.14236206221819195,0.1494829756106486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945609343035683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11833482301906997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15537364895880215,0.0,0.0,0.1430184960267458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15027203057283167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31837420828149954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649121154281873,0.11940494180077943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04853059593543052,0.0,0.09306282370379139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14870954653073704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08903999350934025,0.14236206221819195,0.0,0.13211492941940847,0.0,0.0,0.12968825514148932,0.05900815354544324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12335458750858173,17.493900387832497,11.19135563385109,6.659293919683638,5.1647859739235145,12.542256986791916,12.267156302656659,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
6jopcIekS7Q,Edmonton Animal Rights March 2021 - Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"A compilation of the best moments from the Edmonton Animal Rights March 2021. 

Activists met at Gateway Boulevard on a busy Saturday afternoon to speak up for all oppressed animals. If you have never participated in one, get involved. 

Question for you (answer in the comments section). What is stopping you from going vegan today and joining the right side of history?

If you are vegan but not speaking up in any form for the animals, what is stopping you from protecting them from speciesism today? 

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos.

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** 
We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In today's episode of Debate a Vegan we're at UC Davis. James' girlfriend, who is vegan, asked him to join me at the table to debate whether or not veganism is a moral obligation. We had an interesting discussion where we talked about a range of different topics such as animal intelligence, social Darwinism and backyard eggs. #Veganism #Morality #UCDavis

nDEoPgDqydU,The Transformative Power of Raw Vegan Food | Raw Chef Yin | TEDxUSMNibongTebal,"NOTE FROM TED: While some viewers might find advice provided in this talk to be helpful as a complementary approach, please do not look to this talk for medical advice. We've flagged this talk, which was filmed at a TEDx event, because it appears to fall outside TEDx's curatorial guidelines. The sweeping claims made in this talk are not yet corroborated by scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf

Have you ever thought of being a raw vegan? Will it change your life? 

Well, Raw Chef Yin will share her journey of her transformation. Her mission is to change the perception that raw vegan food is tasteless, too green and totally unappetising. She wants the world to know that raw food can and should be mouth-wateringly scrumptious and delightfully appealing.

Nimai is joined by vegan educator, public speaker, and content creator- Earthling Ed. With his experience in animal advocacy, Ed shares about compassion, shifting stereotypes, and the misinformation fed to us by the meat industry. Recognizing that we don't need a few perfect vegans, we need everyone to do their part- no matter how small- to reduce their contribution to this industry. Ed shares how he has shifted his approach to educating people on the truth, and how he uses his platform today as an empowering catalyst for change.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In 2006, the United Nations stated:

“The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.”

And then four years later, they warned that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty and the worst impacts of climate change.

So why exactly is animal farming bad for the environment?

5WeDsGmWLHw,Mic The Vegan Attacked By All Meat Eating Doctor,"Instead of rationally responding to any of the points Mic the Vegan made in his video about Shawn Baker’s ghastly blood test results, the all meat eating former doctor made a video viciously attacking and slandering Mic. It seems Shawn thinks he can warp reality if he bullies his critics. Anji & Ryan react.

tPBe6FxeGx8,Call To Action For All Vegans | Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"It is so important for vegans to get involved in activism. The animals do not have a voice, so you need to speak up on their behalf. The largest injustice the world has never seen is continuing to happen. Direct activism is the only thing that has ever created social change. 

What is a cube of truth? Edmonton Vegan Outreach is partnered with the Edmonton Chapter of Anonymous for the Voiceless. It is a static peaceful demonstration that shows standard industry practices of factory farming. The slaughterhouse footage shown on the screens also includes animal victims that come from ""free-range"", ""grass-fed"" ""humanely slaughtered"" farms. The footage demonstrates that no matter what label an animal is given, the act of speciesism is unethical. This helps lead non-vegans to the vegan conclusion. Vegan activists not in the cube are able to address any objections the non-vegan may have. 

If you are vegan: go to cubeoftruth.com right now and find your local chapter. If there is no local chapter, start one up. Email edmontonveganoutreach@gmail.com and we will give you advice on how to get more local activists to help you out. 

If you are NOT vegan:

pHcnt-DxRpc,Joaquin Phoenix DESTROYS Dairy Industry | LIVEKINDLY,"Joaquin Phoenix destroyed the dairy industry in his Oscars acceptance speech. Here are Joaquin Phoenix’s top vegan moments. The vegan actor delivered an unforgettable performance as Arthur Fleck in Todd Phillips’ “Joker.” From press tours to acceptance speeches, Phoenix has used his time in the spotlight to shed light on important issues - including veganism, animal rights, and climate change.

Joaquin Phoenix condemned the dairy industry in his Best Actor acceptance speech at the 92nd Academy Awards. Phoenix won the Oscar for his performance in “Joker.”

Ahead of the BAFTA's, where he won the Leading Actor prize, Phoenix attended an animal rights protest. 

At the Golden Globes, Phoenix won Best Actor In A Drama Motion Picture. During his acceptance speech, he thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press for acknowledging the link between animal agriculture and climate change. It is also rumored that Phoenix influenced the decision to adopt a fully vegan menu for the ceremony. 

Following his win at the Golden Globes, Phoenix attended Jane Fonda's Fire Drill Fridays at the Capitol Building. He delivered a powerful message about individual efforts in mitigating climate change. He was also arrested for participating. 

Straight from the SAG Awards ceremony, where he picked up yet another award for his role in ""Joker,"" Phoenix attended a pig vigil. He wants to expose animal agriculture for what it really is. 

Which speech is your favorite?

dmq6ai-4o8Y,why I went plant-based,"Warm Mediterranean Chickpea Lentil Salad

Thought I’d share my story on why I went plant-based while making this delicious salad. I’ve been eating this salad every week for the past 2 months and still crave it even as the weather is getting colder. 

Let me know in the comments below if you want to hear more about my plant-based journey!

Part 2 to come next week 

""Most people who say that they're vegan, they're not really vegan"". When he said that, it really put into perspective just how non vegans view other vegans and veganism. I don't blame him for his ignorance not one bit. The more activism I do and see from others, it keeps becoming clearer as to why veganism is not understood and why Animal Emancipation numbers continue to sit at 0. 

The problem? Not many vegans know what veganism means or how to properly and effectively speak about it. Veganism can't advance if people don't understand it. Instead of getting defensive when others try to offer assistance with one's advocacy, be open to the feedback. I was someone who didn't present the vegan message correctly. I took in that feedback and changed. The animals are desperate for others to do the same as well.

These conclusions were made by this individual with a plate of chicken's flesh in his hand who he just purchased. But we didn't focus on them. We didn't even focus on what was on the screen too much. The target was his mind and he absolutely walked away thinking differently.

AR9vRLXRHR4,Joey Carbstrong DEBATES Tristan Tate (Spoiler: It Didn't Go Well...),"Everyone's favorite street outreacher and online educator Joey Cabrstrong went up against alpha male extraordinaire and sex trafficking defendant Tristan Tate in a debate about veganism.

p3gI9Iw8yF0,Ep.308:  Identifying Animal: DxE's Co-Founder Wayne Hsiung on The Risks of Animal Rescue.,"Wayne Hsiung was released on December 9, 2023 after serving a sentence of 38 days in a Sonoma County (Calif.) jail for trying to free animals from the cruelty of factory farms. I talked to Wayne as he prepared for the trial earlier in the year. He was optimistic, considering he had just beaten the attempts in Utah to convict him on similar charges. As we recount 2023, we reprise my conversation with Wayne in this encore podcast presentation.

r5rnk21HfF0,2019 Animal Liberation March,"On June 1st, over 1,000 activists took to the streets of San Francisco to participate in the second annual Animal Liberation March. Viewed by thousands of people around the world on Facebook livestreams, the march, which was organized by Direct Action Everywhere, sent onlookers a message that animals exist for their own purposes and should not be exploited for food, clothing, entertainment or experimentation.  Along the parade route, TheirTurn spoke to onlookers to get their reactions.

PLEASE SHARE! :D

When I watched this back, I thought I could have done much more to hold his feet to the fire - prod him to reflect further... hold him accountable.

But as I remarked, he was very visibly, to me at the time at least, uncomfortable - and keen to end the discussion, which is why I was so soft.

- To counter my concerns: there's no way of KNOWING what would have been best.
- perhaps the line I took, where I essentially described him as a ""lost-cause,"" was most effective...?

To be boxed into such a category - lacking in principle and ethical consistency...
That would have eaten away at me for sure.

That being said - he's not the ONLY person in the picture...

Thanks for watching!

In today's video I #debate Keane, a student in Boston who is unsure if k*lling homeless people is justifiable and thinks that growing humans in test tubes so that we can harvest their organs is ethical. However, how does all of this inform his views on eating animal products and can I get him to come around to #veganism?

*** Bio ***

I'm Paul Kerton, a former Personal Trainer and Vegan Nutritionist,  I am now a full-time Social Media Influencer. Not so long ago, in a misguided attempt to try and grow muscle as quickly as possible, I ended up eating more animal products than probably anyone you've ever met. Through research, I came to learn the deleterious effects that eating even quite trivial amounts of animal products has on one's health and through personal experience, I found that far from being a hindrance to sports performance, a well-planned vegan diet is actually optimal! Then with an open heart, I looked at how we treat animals in order for them to end up on our plates and it shook me to the core. I could not believe that for so long I fell for the lies that others tell us, that we tell ourselves, in order that we perpetuate this destructive behavior. Destructive to ourselves, the beautiful, intelligent sentient beings that are here with us and indeed our very planet. To try and put right my part in all of this I was compelled to overcome my fear of being filmed for YouTube and television, appearing on the radio and more recently public speaking. On a spiritual level, I've come to realise that my fellow man too is suffering. If I won't see harm come to a chicken I've never met then why would I be unkind to my brother man? If someone is being aggressive or unkind toward me, surely the suffering inflicted on them in the past is simply spilling over? Do I want to add to that, or can I step out of my ego long enough to forgive them and maybe break the cycle of negativity?

Wayne Hsiung is an active ambassador of truth as co-founder of Direct Action Everywhere (DxE). Wayne is a former lawyer and now a full time activist.

tblLEiCJrUI,Selena Gomez can’t eat THIS animal.,"The fact that we draw a line when it comes to eating certain species of animals just shows how inconsistent and hypocritical our consumption of animals really is.

We eat the animals we do because of the cultures we are raised in, not because there is a moral difference between a pig and a dog, or a rabbit and a lamb. Our use and abuse of animals for food is completely contradictory and inconsistent, although it is definitely positive that we already recognise eating certain species of animals is wrong. However, it’s important that we align our actions with our values and recognise that in the same way eating dogs, cats and rabbits is wrong, eating pigs, cows, lambs and the other animals we eat is also wrong as well. #selenagomez #veganism",Earthling Ed,0,18,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07906996621269274,0.5766820466672391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1670371024611634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43946467348211776,0.0,0.5930824774728268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11450662613800264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16008707714259648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12432838747096589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10120536329131706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15481804282611966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.494037891612188,17.91747213691874,13.030250281476574,5.940171252720432,3.8066624897703196,8.128144739295358,9.081563122381263,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

0zLmycbiKNQ,DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung and ex pig farmer Brad Johnson who saved pigs,"Former Smithfield pig farm manager Bradley Johnson was deeply steeped in the industry. Then he met activists who would take him down a dramatically new path. When the company asked him to gas some of the piglets who were too small or weak for slaughter, he sent them to sanctuary instead. The Smithfield machine discovered his act of compassion, and Bradley was faced with dire consequences for his job, his family, and even his freedom.  Brad lost his car, his home, and his job because of the prosecution against him.  Brad is blowing the whistle on the industry and defending the right to rescue animals from abuse. 

Speakers include Wayne Hsiung, Brad Johnson, Amy Jean Davis and Ava
