zOlN6d1CP9A,"Peter Singer: Animal Liberation, Forty Years On","Peter Singer‚Äôs Animal Liberation, often credited with starting the modern animal rights movement, was first published in September 1975. In this lecture, the author assesses how well the argument has stood up over that period, and what progress has been made towards the changes in our treatment of animals that the book advocates.

Peter Singer, Princeton University and University of Melbourne

In this video the outreach questions I have captioned in purple to show how to progress the outreach conversation easily.

It's also important to remember as an outreacher a ""good conversation"" isn't one where the person goes vegan on the spot. It's a conversation where you 1 hold the person accountable for their actions, and 2 educate them on what animal rights is about.

tPBe6FxeGx8,Call To Action For All Vegans | Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"It is so important for vegans to get involved in activism. The animals do not have a voice, so you need to speak up on their behalf. The largest injustice the world has never seen is continuing to happen. Direct activism is the only thing that has ever created social change. 

What is a cube of truth? Edmonton Vegan Outreach is partnered with the Edmonton Chapter of Anonymous for the Voiceless. It is a static peaceful demonstration that shows standard industry practices of factory farming. The slaughterhouse footage shown on the screens also includes animal victims that come from ""free-range"", ""grass-fed"" ""humanely slaughtered"" farms. The footage demonstrates that no matter what label an animal is given, the act of speciesism is unethical. This helps lead non-vegans to the vegan conclusion. Vegan activists not in the cube are able to address any objections the non-vegan may have. 

If you are vegan: go to cubeoftruth.com right now and find your local chapter. If there is no local chapter, start one up. Email edmontonveganoutreach@gmail.com and we will give you advice on how to get more local activists to help you out. 

If you are NOT vegan: 

1. watch Dominion on Youtube at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko

2. explain to us in the comment section below why the actions in this video are justified against animals.

ZLPD_wQLQbQ,The Corporatization of Veganism & How Human and Animal Liberation are Interconnected,"Has the vegan movement been co-opted? Is veganism just a piece of the agenda of the world elite to sterilize us with soy and force feed us synthetic food and lab-grown meat?  

Today's video is my full speech at the Greater Reset Integration in Morelia Mexico, about the corporatization of veganism and how the vegan movement has been co-opted for profit - yet why veganism and animal liberation are still key to achieving our own freedom!

Confused about veganism? THIS video explains why veganism matters if we care about freedom and liberation!

Wayne Hsiung is an expert in social movement, and he‚Äôs a massive proponent of getting the animal rights movement to that crucial number. Wayne started out as a corporate attorney and swiftly realized that more was needed to move the needle. The world needs a political shift. He co-founded Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) to change the system and inspire other activists to continue his work. Wayne is known for staging open rescues and documenting atrocious slaughterhouses and feedlots, and his footage has been captured by the mainstream media and garnered hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. If you‚Äôre passionate about social change‚Äîwhether it has to do with animal or human rights‚ÄîWayne‚Äôs knowledge will hit home.

#UnchainedTV is LIVE at the courthouse for the ongoing Utah TRIAL of Direct Action Everywhere co-founder Wayne Hsiung and #DxE member Paul Picklesimer. These two men face 5 years in prison for removing 2 sick piglets from a massive Utah pig factory farm. There, they videotaped conditions described this way by the New York Times: ‚ÄúThe film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.‚Äù 

Our team coverage includes commentary by well-known attorney Nathan Semmel, Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, Gwenna Hunter, founder of Vegans for Black Lives Matter, famed animal rescuer Simone Reyes, philanthropist Mick Davoudian, dog behavior consultant Maryam Kamali, trial watcher Karen La Cava and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah to find out from #DxE leaders what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

Today's video:

In today's video, I'm back on GB News taking on a panel that question me about plant-based alternatives, the healthfulness of vegan diets, and I almost get whiplash reacting to baffling questions about protein and 'false vegetables'. 

Mike Parry has referred to himself as a 'sausage expert' and yet infamously ate a vegan sausage sandwich believing that it was meat and called it 'luscious and lovely'.

We've flagged this talk, which was filmed at a TEDx event, because it appears to fall outside TEDx's curatorial guidelines. The sweeping claims made in this talk are not yet corroborated by scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf

Have you ever thought of being a raw vegan? Will it change your life? 

Well, Raw Chef Yin will share her journey of her transformation. Her mission is to change the perception that raw vegan food is tasteless, too green and totally unappetising. She wants the world to know that raw food can and should be mouth-wateringly scrumptious and delightfully appealing.

That's why it's interesting with this bystander because there was never a food discussion in this conversation. It seemed to be where he always wanted to focus though. No matter what I said to him, all he wanted to do was talk about the oppression he puts in his mouth. I also asked him 4 times what he would do if he and his family were in the victim's position and not once did he answer. 

I may have lost my cool a bit on this one but compared to what I actually wanted to say, I think it was ok. Nothing worse than standing next to an actual animal oppressor with actual blood on their hands. You always want to remain as professional as possible though, regardless of who you're speaking to. Our emotions can't always be controlled but it's a must you find a way to balance them. The best thing to do when you feel you're about to lose control is walk away. You're never obligated to stand and talk with anyone.

cNcp4mJcYTY,Lab-grown meat has been DEBUNKED! ü•©,"This farmer‚Äôs rebuke of cell cultured meat is exceptionally ironic considering the chickens we slaughter for meat have been selectively bred to grow to slaughter weight in about five weeks.

This incredibly fast rate of growth means that the bird's young bones are unable to support them, breaking under the weight and strain of their disfigured bodies -¬†resulting in painful lameness which prevents them from eating, drinking or even standing up. Many die from dehydration or starvation because they are unable to access food and water points.¬†Organ failure is also extremely common, with millions of birds dying from heart and lung failure before they even reach the age of slaughter.

So perhaps the real question we should be asking is, how can we ethically justify eating animals that grow so fast that their organs fail, they cannot stand up and they live in constant suffering?

Sadly, this farmer is using her lack understanding about cell-cultured meat as a reason for deciding that it must be bad. However, not understanding how something works is not a valid criticism in and of itself of that thing. So just because this farmer doesn‚Äôt understand how cell-cultured meat is created, does not therefore mean cell cultured meat is bad, especially as you can literally research how it works.

What is bad though, is needlessly causing suffering to tens of billions of animals and then slaughtering them.

DAY 3 #SMITHFIELDTRIAL - 2 Men Face Decade Prison Term for Piglet Rescue!

#UnchainedTV is LIVE at the courthouse for the ongoing Utah TRIAL of Direct Action Everywhere co-founder Wayne Hsiung and #DxE member Paul Picklesimer. These two men face over a DECADE in prison for removing 2 piglets they said were very sick as they videotaped themselves inside a massive Utah pig factory farm. There, they videotaped conditions described this way by the New York Times: ‚ÄúThe film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.‚Äù 
Our team coverage includes commentary by famed attorney Lisa Bloom, Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, well-known attorney Nathan Semmel, Gwenna Hunter, founder of Vegans for Black Lives Matter, famed animal rescuer Simone Reyes, trial watcher Karen La Cava and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah to find out what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

UGyVTkv9prQ,ANIMALS BETRAYED COALITION. A Blueprint for Animal Liberation. Part 1: The Struggle.,"In Part 1, of a series explaining a proposed Blueprint for Animal Liberation, ANIMALS BETRAYED COALITION, I read out an essay 'The Struggle against the State' by Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian activist and anarchist who commanded an anarchist army of up to 110,000 troops in the Russian civil war exactly 100 years ago in Ukraine!

If ever there was a poignant time to listen to one of the greatest organisers and warriors (and, by the way, writers and therefore philosophers) fighting for total liberation , then it is now in my opinion.

In Part 2 I will explain the idea of the ANIMALS BETRAYED COALITION, which is a new network of active (legally) AR/anti-vivisection groups, to help us organise and recruit, similar in principle to the Animal Rights Coalition (ARC) of the 90's which was the foundation to the successes of that era in my opinion.

A network of local and (legally) active groups joining in force, growing in numbers, focusing on 1 campaign, against LABCORP (used to be Huntingdon Life Sciences), which obviously Camp Beagle and Free the MBR beagles are by their nature contributing to.
In the meantime here is a link to the website (everything is detailed here):
https://animalsbc1998.wixsite.com/abc1998
https://www.change.org/o/animals_betrayed_coalition

The ABC website is a digital version of the 1st ABC newsletter 'The Rubicon', copies of which can be picked up at Camp Beagle, which many you have already got. So far 2,500 copies have been printed and almost half of those have been distributed
I hope you share with us, some of the ideas laid out here and then onto others. 
We are surely all agreed we need a very large, radical, widespread, effective and ultimately victorious movement, unable to be challenged, penetrated or crushed by the State (the people who fund, protect and prop up animal abuse industries and their agents).

This is 1 proposal of how we might go about the task of actually achieving Animal Liberation, it by  no means claims to be complete, comprehensive or the only way to go about the much needed job ahead of us. 
ABC is a legal network and does not carry out or condone illegal behaviour.

CfFSnW1AFfw,She is Stranded on a Deserted Island |  Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"This non-vegan came up with some justifications for using animals against their will. Do her arguments hold water? Especially water near a deserted island? 

QUESTION: Do you think killing animals is justified when you are in a survival situation?

Go to https://www.3movies.wtf/edmvo and watch the videos. 

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter and We The Free Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos.

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless. To join in on animal rights activism: cubeoftruth.com OR activism.wtf

***** What is Speciesism? *****
Speciesism, in applied ethics and the philosophy of animal rights, the practice of treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species; also, the belief that this practice is justified.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In the UK, the idea of blending plants and animal products together to create a range of hybrid products is becoming an increasingly popular concept. This is particularly because of Smug Dairy and Quorn. But is this idea actually a good idea or will it actually lead to more animal products being consumed overall? After all, who are these products actually for?

In today's video I dive into the subject and discuss what my thoughts and feelings are about this emerging and highly controversial range of food products.

About Peter Singer:

Peter Singer has been described as the world‚Äôs most influential philosopher. Born in Melbourne in 1946, he has been professor of bioethics at Princeton University since 1999. His many books include Animal Liberation - often credited with triggering the modern animal rights movement - Practical Ethics, The Life You Can Save, The Most Good You Can Do, and Ethics in the Real World. In 2023, he published Animal Liberation Now, a fully revised and updated version of the 1975 original.

Singer‚Äôs writings have also inspired the movement known as effective altruism, and he is the founder of the charity The Life You Can Save. In 2021 he was awarded the $1 million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture, which he donated to nonprofit organizations working for the causes he supports. In 2023 he received the Frontiers of Knowledge Prize for the Humanities, from the Spanish BBVA Foundation.",2025-05-09T13:00:48Z,Big Think,27,"['Education', 'Educational Videos', 'Videos', 'Faster smarter', 'big think', 'bigthink']",PT1H55M1S,hd,true,20618,792,273

oywQtMrulhg,Why Go Vegan? | The Most IMPORTANT Speech You Will Hear Today!,"This vegan speech could change the way you think and change how you live your life. Filmed at Exeter University, UK 2017.

Why Vegan? My names Chris Hines and I'm a vegan, animal rights activist from the UK. After watching a video called 'Meet Your Meat' back in 2002, I was confronted with the reality of what happens to animals in our food system and this set me on the path to living a vegan lifestyle. I felt terrible knowing that I had been contributing to what I had seen for so many years and felt betrayed by the system that kept all these horrors tucked away from the publics eyes. 

What I have come to realise is that what we are doing to animals is wrong and we have a way to help fix this. This is speech I gave at Exeter University in January of 2017 which discusses the ethics of veganism and how we lack the justifications to be treating animals in this way. Please watch with an open mind and open heart. You can really help make a difference.

If you need any information on going vegan or want to discuss anything you have heard in this video then please get in contact using the links below. 

Thank you so much for watching and I really hope this inspires you to make a change for the animals, the planet and ourselves.

Much love

DZ7qdSMD17w,Piers Morgans DESTROYS Vegan For Not Caring About ALL Animals' Rights,"Piers Morgan Uncensored is joined by animal rights activist and vegan Joey Carbstrong and celebrity chef John Mountain who decided to 'ban all vegans' from his restaurant to discuss John's decision and whether there is some legitimacy to Joey and others' claims that we should eat less meat for the planet and to help in the fight against animal cruelty.

John explains that after one vegan customer was rightfully upset with their service, he was bombarded by multiple one-star reviews from vegans due to some of the lack of non-meat options at his restaurant. Joey says that John should 'stop crying' over one review and instead focus on millions of animals that suffer cruelty.

Piers and Joey then descend into a heated debate over the treatment of animals and eating meat. Piers suggests that Joey doesn't care about millions of bees dying every year during the growth of almonds (a common substitute in vegan products such as milk) - but Joey believes that they are dying for other reasons so there is no need to focus on them.

4dCjjO3-RGc,ANGRY DAIRY FARMERS TRY TO TAKE MY CAMERA - My Craziest Vegan Outreach Ever!!!,"*Please be kind to each other and about the people in my videos as many of them come to my channel to watch the videos. üôèüèº

These farmers came for an argument. They tell us that they care for and love their animals...  but some of the things they say about both animals and humans are absolutely disgusting. It makes me so sad that they have animals in their care.

They eventually threw a hissy fit and left.... but they'd noticed that I was filming and came back a few minutes later and tried to swipe my camera. Luckily I have it strapped down!!

As soon as they left, a young lady who was watching from the side (Cara) came to have a conversation with me and she turned out to be an amazing human being.

Good people and people who do bad things surround us! We just have to find the good and tell them the truth without fear, anger or judgement. That's how we will change this cruel world! 

If you would like to support my work I've taken the decision to start a Patreon. My reasons for doing so are on the link below...

https://www.patreon.com/ClifGrant?utm...

Ultimately I'm trying to make people stop for a moment and think - and to reconnect with the compassion for animals that already lies inside most of us.

If we take the time to inform people properly, together, one step at a time, one change at a time,  ‚Äì when it all adds up, it will be one enormous result for the animals.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I also hope to talk about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

#UnchainedTV is LIVE at the courthouse for the ongoing Utah TRIAL of Direct Action Everywhere co-founder Wayne Hsiung and #DxE member Paul Picklesimer. These two men face over a DECADE in prison for removing 2 sick piglets from a massive Utah pig factory farm. There, they videotaped conditions described this way by the New York Times: ‚ÄúThe film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.‚Äù 

Our team coverage includes commentary by well-known attorney Nathan Semmel, Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, Gwenna Hunter, founder of Vegans for Black Lives Matter, famed animal rescuer Simone Reyes, TheirTurn founder Donny Moss, Environmental Specialist Hoorik Telle, trial watcher Karen La Cava and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah to find out from #DxE leaders what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

https://www.chefaj.com/5-delicious-low-fat-dinner-recipes

Today I had the pleasure of talking to Mic The Vegan who I met at a vegan influencer conference last year and was immediately impressed by.

Mic the Vegan is a vegan science YouTuber that covers a variety of topics from the health effects of a vegan diet and the environmental impact of eating animal products to the sociological phenomenon of casual animal exploitation. Based in the Iowa, he regularly tackles debunking the myths that perpetuate harmful dietary and lifestyle behaviors - all with a drop of humor that only he thinks is funny. Key facts: Mic is short for microphone and Mike/Michael, NOT MICK! He is not a doctor but he is currently studying Public Health at the Master's level.  Please check out his extraordinary channel at youtube.com/c/micthevegan.

Thank you for watching.

For years, I begged the government to help the Ridglan dogs. But instead of investigating Ridglan, the government tried to throw me in jail after I took a blind puppy out of her cage and to the vet. 

Now the tables have turned, with a court finding not only that animals are abused, but that the government has, de facto, been part of the cover-up. 

This is just the first step. We‚Äôll need your help. Click the link in the bio, if you want to join our meeting this weekend to discuss what‚Äôs next.

The lyrics of the poem are here:

Once upon a time
In a not so distant land
She opened her eyes
And realized she cannot stand
Tied to the pole
All her life
Beaten, raped, and assaulted
Waiting for that God damn knife
She wasn‚Äôt my sister, best friend or my mother
She was a living being
With a heart, a brain and beat
Just like any other
The last thing that she saw
Was a knife held by a man
Oh let me tell you where it all began
It‚Äôs the very thing you are holding in your hand
Espresso, muffins and choco latte
It all comes from nothing but animal cruelty
The milk in your food
Was stolen from the calf
Mixed with artificial hormones
That you are drinking on their behalf
Slaughtered and hung upside down
They watch their friends being killed until the dawn
You buy the final product and you pay your hard earned money of course
The cow‚Äôs pain and sufferings are not important factors of the economy
They say,
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt survive on plants‚Äù
‚ÄúMeat gives you Protein‚Äù
Oh but the horrors in the slaughter houses, once witnessed cannot be unseen
Once upon a time
In this very land
There was a cow
Whose dead body was sold by this very brand
What now one must wonder?
I‚Äôll tell you how to put an end to this mass murder
Research, learn, raise your voice and break the silence
That‚Äôs the only way to end this violence",2020-02-03T17:00:11Z,Animal Save Movement,29,"['through her eyes', 'through her eye', 'through her', 'through', 'her', 'her eyes', 'her eye', 'a poem for animal liberation', 'a poem for animal', 'a poem for', 'animal liberation', 'hyberdad animal save', 'animal save', 'animal save movement', 'climate save movement', 'health save movement', 'animal poem', 'a poem', 'for animal liberation', 'vegan india', 'india vs new zealand 5th t20 highlights', 'india']",PT2M54S,hd,false,2228,170,23

Every year in Australia, around 12 million of these male chicks are macerated (ground up alive) or gassed in the first day of their lives as 'waste products' of the industry. A large number of abnormal or deformed females are also macerated.

Now, for the first time ever in Australia, the horrific reality of this maceration has been captured on camera, along with the painful de-beaking inflicted on the female chicks. Filmed at one of the country's largest hatcheries, owned by Specialised Breeders Australia (SBA) and located at Huntly, just outside of Bendigo, Victoria, the footage highlights the inexcusable cruelty and suffering behind every carton of eggs, from caged to free-range.

--------------------------------------VIDEO NOTES--------------------------------------

In Tel Aviv on 21 November 2019 I spoke publicly for the first time on animal liberation. The Machar Conference is an atheist conference hosted by the Israeli Atheist Association, but the organisers kindly let me speak on veganism, with the leader of the organisation telling me that Christopher Hitchens inspired him to platform a style of thought, rather than a style of talk (it's not what you think, but how you think).

During the talk I displayed in realtime the number of animals that had been killed worldwide since I began speaking. Billions of animals are exploited every year for our convenience and entertainment, and nothing could be more ethically obvious than that this must come to an end.

I hope those of you who are not vegan will consider the gravity of this issue, and of our dietary choices, and do what they can to relieve the world of this unnecessary suffering.

MSvddyJ9BBk,Diabetic goes vegan for 180 days. This happened.,"I‚Äôve been on a low fat plant based diet for 180 days. Being a diabetic, I‚Äôve seen major changes in my insulin sensitivity after switching from a low carb diet to a healthy high carb vegan diet. I cover what exactly I eat in a day as a type 1 diabetic, how I prepare my meals in a blood sugar friendly way, how my blood glucose reacted, and how my insulin needs changed during and after this transition.   

If you are looking for a healthy sustainable diabetes diet this video might inspire you as I share my experience in a whole lot of detail with focus on diabetes and blood sugar management.

n0goqFH9BQM,What Is The Animal Liberation Movement? - The Ethical Compass,"What Is The Animal Liberation Movement? In this informative video, we will discuss the animal liberation movement, a crucial effort aimed at ending the suffering and exploitation of non-human animals. This movement advocates for the rights and welfare of animals, emphasizing our moral responsibility to treat them with respect. We will explore the concept of speciesism, which prioritizes human interests over those of other species, and how this movement challenges that belief. 

Key thinkers like Peter Singer and Tom Regan have shaped the philosophical foundation of animal liberation, presenting different approaches to animal rights. We'll examine how their ideas influence practical changes in areas such as factory farming and animal testing. Additionally, we will reflect on the ethical implications of our actions regarding animal welfare and how empathy can guide our moral choices. 

Join us as we delve into the importance of extending moral consideration beyond humans and consider the impact our feelings toward animals can have on our decision-making. This discussion is vital for anyone interested in advocating for the rights and welfare of animals. Subscribe to our channel for more engaging conversations about ethics and morality!

acePa05Cxpo,Here's What Happens To Your Brain And Body When You Go Vegan | The Human Body,"Thinking about skipping out on meat and dairy? Going vegan is becoming increasingly more common, but is it actually good for you? 

Following is the transcript of the video:

What happens to your body when you go vegan?

Thinking of making the jump to a vegan diet? You‚Äôre not alone.

In your first few weeks, you may feel especially tired. Without meat, vegans often have a hard time getting enough vitamin B12 and iron, which helps make red blood cells and transport oxygen throughout the body. But it‚Äôs nothing a supplement or handful of nuts can‚Äôt fix.

You may also discover that foods don‚Äôt taste the way they used to. That‚Äôs because your zinc levels have taken a hit, affecting your overall sense of taste and smell.

On the plus side, expect to lose some weight right away! After switching, new vegans lost an average of 10 pounds over a 10 month period. Plus, a 2009 study found that average BMI was lower for vegans than all other diets.

Another benefit that you may experience is a healthy decrease in cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart disease risk. In 1999, a study showed that vegans were 24% less likely to have clogged arteries from saturated fat and cholesterol.

While your arteries are better off, your bones may not be. If you‚Äôre like most Americans who get their daily calcium from dairy products, you may see a dip in calcium levels.

But you can combat this simply by boosting your intake of kale, broccoli, and other leafy greens. Plus, cutting out dairy might make you more ‚Ä¶ regular. 60% of humans don‚Äôt have the enzyme to properly digest lactose in dairy. The result is cramping, bloating, and even diarrhea. Swapping dairy with high fiber veggies will make bathroom trips a lot more productive.

Like any diet, veganism has its pros and cons. Be sure to research and see which diet is best for you.

8WSrRV5ovPE,EVERY Vegan Needs to Hear This! Are You Advocating Cruelty? [SPEECH],"Are you advocating cruelty in your vegan activism and outreach? It can feel easier to offer things like ""Meatless Mondays"" or ""humane"" alternatives than ask people to go ""fully"" vegan. But when we take this approach, we're not only doing a disservice to the animals, but also to non-vegans themselves. We're deciding FOR them that they can't handle the full truth. We're deciding FOR them that they can't, or won't, make the decision to go vegan. 

In this speech, I address how to ensure we as activists avoid advocating the very things we are fighting against. In addition to covering examples of what NOT to say in our activism, I also touch on some approaches of what TO say‚Äîand HOW to say it, as well as ways to remove common barriers that arise when speaking with non-vegans.

Today's video:

#Wellness is not an ally to veganism. In fact, the wellness space often peddles pseudoscientific nonsense and encourages people to consume products and engage in practices that are extremely harmful to animals. From bee sting therapy and fish scale face masks to raw milk and carnivore diets, the only thing the wellness space seems to care less about than evidence is animal cruelty.

0VHK8wpFci4,The breakfast that helped me lose 40lbs as a vegan,"Maybe if I post this meal 50x people will realise I do truly eat the same thing each day. ü§ì

Cool story:
I finished a bulk in April and since then I‚Äôve lost 9lbs of the fat I gained.
It‚Äôs been very easy because I decided to just eat the same breakfast and lunch each day and make my habits solid as a rock.

The only difference now to when I started my weight loss journey is I do use protein powder, but the calories are the same because I used to add banana or a sweetener.

This is a perfect meal for fat loss as it‚Äôs filling and low calorie. I use quick oats as they cook faster and I‚Äôm lazy and impatient.

Vp8-rYqCAnM,Animal Rights Extremists: Trespassing to Rescue Chickens,"Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) is an animal liberation group that is notorious for its large-scale actions which sometimes involve illegal tactics such as civil disobedience and trespassing. 

DxE sees their actions as essential to forwarding their cause of exposing injustices in the Animal Agriculture System. However, some of  DxE‚Äôs opponents, especially those who have been directly targeted by DxE, have labeled them as actual terrorists after their aggressive occupations and protests.  

VICE documents as DxE embark on their largest actions to date: occupying an egg farm in Petaluma, CA and removing chickens from the property.  VICE also speaks with the co-owner of the egg farm who claims that DxE‚Äôs actions are not only illegal, but detrimental to the possibility of a constructive dialogue between Animal Rights Activists and members of the Animal Agriculture Industry.

Lyrics:

It's getting late but I'm sleepless, 
going out of my mind.
Constantly feeling the pressure
no I don't see you, I'm blind.

Bridge:
We need an expedition, 
to cure all their bad mistakes.

I try to dismiss my problems,
somehow I'm stuck with them.
Story of a life that was taken, 
you work and then you die.

Chorus:
Government's fault, 
they try to kill your essence.
People will raise 'cause they, 
have lost their patience.

Whatever may happen tomorrow, 
something will change with time.
Possible in the near future,
we will go over the line.

Bridge:
We need an expedition, 
to cure all their bad mistakes.

Maybe it matters to someone,
that you're not fighting alone.
That we're feeling your anger,
and listening to your tone.

Chorus:
Government's fault, 
they try to kill your essence.
People will raise 'cause they, 
have lost their patience.
And when we'll march,
towards the sun to find the ending story.
We won't apologize no more,
for taking our glory.",2012-05-04T07:14:09Z,Clade,10,"['video clip', 'clade', 'the animal liberation', 'luka marcetic', 'war', 'rebellion', 'rebel', 'revolution', 'music video', 'matej pecaver', 'animal liberation']",PT2M54S,sd,false,15555,108,6

ABOUT THE OXFORD UNION SOCIETY: The Oxford Union is the world's most prestigious debating society, with an unparalleled reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to Oxford. Since 1823, the Union has been promoting debate and discussion not just in Oxford University, but across the globe.

The Oxford Union is deeply grateful and encouraged by the messages of support in response to our determination to uphold free speech. During our 200 year history, many have tried to shut us down. As the effects of self-imposed censorship on university campuses, social media and the arts show no signs of dissipating, the importance of upholding free speech remains as critical today as it did when we were founded in 1823. Your support is critical in enabling The Oxford Union to continue its mission without interruption and without interference.

However, it's when the conversation begins to focus on his moral justification for eating meat that his arguments become particularly fraught with disturbing and shocking consequences.

Today's video:

#Homesteading has become really popular on social media with content creators getting millions of views. However, is the romanticised portrayal of homesteading really an accurate depiction of the reality of homesteading? 

In today's video, I react to a selection of videos from homesteaders and analyse the arguments that they use.

eYU5FwNxgtc,Animal Rights Activist Wayne Hsiung Jailed; Yulin Dog Meat Trade,"19-year China resident Jerry Grey and I discuss the case of Wayne Hsiung, co-founder of the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), who was recently sentenced to 3 months in prison and 2 years' probation during which he will be barred from any contact with 15 fellow activists who are among his closest friends for the ""crime"" of rescuing sick and dying animals from ""farms"" that were violating California animal welfare regulations right and left. We also discuss Wayne's investigation of the dog meat trade in Yulin, China, his rescue of dogs from ""farms"" there, and China's 2020 ban on dog meat.

Update: Wayne has now been released from prison, but several DxE activists, including Wayne, still face felony charges. Meanwhile, the animal agribusinesses DxE investigated have faced no charges for their widespread violations of animal welfare regulations--which would do little to protect animals from pain and suffering even if they were enforced.

Addressing the Upper House for the first time, new senator for the Animal Justice Party, Emma Hurst, criticized the Government for failing to protect animals, and implored members from both sides of Parliament to work with her to change the way our society treats animals in NSW. 

In her address she said, ‚ÄúAnimal cruelty is not a left or right issue. But sadly it is one that our government has failed to respond to. And that‚Äôs why I decided to become part of this Parliament. I believe in NSW we can do better.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe fate of each of these animals rests with our willingness to choose kindness over greed, respectability over indifference, and to be leaders instead of led.‚Äù The vegan bodybuilding MP spoke of the 4Corner‚Äôs live animal export vision exposed in 2011 and gave explicit examples of animal suffering on farms in NSW which saw visitors in the gallery and various MPs in tears.

The MP‚Äôs promise ‚Äòto the animals‚Äô, was the climax of her speech stating, ‚ÄúNo matter if you are skin, scales, fur or feathers, no matter the supposed value of your financial worth, or lack thereof, native or non-native, rodent, or fish, or cow, or dog, I will protect you. I stand by you. I will fiercely defend you. It is our party that will keep that promise, and we will never, ever let you down. You have all of me.‚Äù

She is now one of two Animal Justice Party MPs elected to the upper house in NSW who hold the balance of power with nine other crossbenchers.",2019-05-31T03:07:35Z,Emma Hurst,22,['Vegan; animal rights; animal welfare; animal law; animals; politics'],PT18M50S,hd,false,5895,628,105

Support me by BUYING my MUSIC please ;) Thanks! https://vegetablepolice.bandcamp.com/

It definitely didn't go the way I planned... He's stronger than he looks.

After Vegan Gains gets out of the hospital following my viscous attack on him, I'd like to chill with him someday ;)  He's misunderstood, and from what I've seen, he's a genuinely good human being.  

I thought this would be a hilarious video.  Walking up to Vegan Gains, who clearly is very strong and obviously gets enough protein, and yelling ""Where do you get your protein bitch!!?""  I love the final result, and I really just want to make people laugh ;)  Bring awareness to plant based diets through humour.  That's what I'm here to do ;)

2w5AWKDdV9g,This Speech Will Make You Go Vegan! - Clif Grant at The Irish Vegan Festival,"It's been a couple of years since I last spoke at the Irish Vegan Festival due to the awful lockdowns that we have all endured. I recently came across this speech from the last time the festival took place.

I talk about my early years and my journey to veganism, I tell the story of the what the animals have to endure and leave a message of hope at the end.

I really hope you enjoy it; and if you aren't already vegan, that it touches your heart in some way.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I'll be discussing this simple concept along with related issues such as diet, health, the environment and epidemiology.

Finally, I'll be talking about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

GLs-L-1s8cg,Animal Liberation: How Do We Get There? ~Dr. Steve Best,"""Have you ever wondered why is it so hard to convince someone to go vegan?
We dont need to tell you how morally initiatory and how nutritiously simple veganism is. So how come it is so hard, even for many people who define themselves as ""animal lovers"", to become vegans? It is a question we have constantly asked ourselves when we were ""vegan converters"". Could it be that the obstacle to veganism is the messengers? Not enough health food stores? The price of soy milk? Not enough vegan celebrities? Not enough visual evidence about what is going on in factory farms? You know it is not any of these.""

""It is a rather banal and self evident idea that many activists think of at some point in their lives, but we feel that mostly it pops up in times of despair and disbelief while it should be the primal concept at all times regardless of the state of affairs within the animal rights movement or with your own activism.""

What exploited nonhumans need to be liberated is very simple: they need humans to be extinct.
This may be a daunting technical task but it is still a technical task.
What is IMPOSSIBLE is to liberate these nonhumans and keep humans alive.

igQf2f5mKfA,What Is Vegan? What Do Vegans Eat? - The Vegan Diet,"http://serious-fitness-programs.com/weightloss
Follow Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheSeriousfitness

Vitamin b12 you need:
http://amzn.to/2qpKShk
or 
http://amzn.to/2s0HNFS

It is no wonder why as Vegans are one of the hottest diet topics for many people for many different reasons. Some do it for animals, some do it for the environment and others for health reasons. Unfortunately, following a diet based exclusively on plants may put some people at a higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is especially true when vegan diets are not well planned.

In this video I will give you healthy foods that vegans can consume to obtain all the protein, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients needed for optimal health.

Vegans do not eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, or any foods containing them. A vegan diet relies on plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. A vegan diet can be a healthful and nutritionally adequate diet; however, a vegan must make sure they eat enough foods with protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, and omega-3  fatty acids. 

Here‚Äôs what do vegans eat

No 1: fruits and vegetables.
Fruits and veggies are probably the most common and frequent food category that vegans eat as they offer many different choices to try  besides their high vitamin content. Single fruits, salads, veggie sticks, dips, stir-fried veggies are just a few of the many choices you can eat as a vegan.

No 2: Beans and legumes.
Since the vegan diet completely lacks of any animal protein, beans and legumes can function as good protein replacements. You can eat for example, white beans, kidney beans, peas, black eyed peas, chickpeas, lentils, broad beans and other legumes for your daily protein intake.

No 3: Soy products
Soy is very popular in vegan diets because of it is a high protein and very versatile food that is used to make soy milk, tofu, yogurts, cheese and other soy products you can use in all your main meals like breakfasts, salads, sandwiches and desserts. Look up in your local health food store or supermarket and you‚Äôll find plenty of soy products to incorporate in your vegan meals.

No 4: Grains 
Grains like oatmeal, breads, tortillas, and pastas are great sources of carbs and fiber which aid digestion and keep you feel fuller for longer. However, it‚Äôs best to go for whole wheat grains and not refined ones as these are the healthiest and contain the most nutrients.

No 5: Other extra foods
Other foods that you can eat in a vegan diet to increase your energy and nutrient intake are nuts and seeds or spreads like popcorn, pumpkin seeds, pecans, sprouts and so on. 
Hummus, tahini, and nut butters will also help spike your protein levels besides making ordinary veggies taste more filling.

Supplements
A vitamin that many vegans tend to lack, and perhaps you‚Äôve already heard of is B-12. B-12 is commonly found in most animal protein sources so when people are switching to a full vegan diet, the levels of this vitamin will inevitably drop. However, you can take it by consuming fermented and fortified foods or diet supplements that contain b-12.

F9U1ifVezMA,The Human is Vegan: An Ethical Argument  by Gary Yourofsky,"This talk, given at Lonestar College - Cy-Fair on Oct 17th, 2013 features Gary Yourofsky (www.adappt.org) an animal right activist and lecturer.  Gary has given over 2,000 talks concerning animal rights in over 170 schools in America.

Mr. Yourofsky was invited to multiple philosophy classes in order to present a rational argument that students could evaluate and react to through a process of question and answer.  Mr. Yourofsky did so with his own budget and his arguments should be seen as his solely.  

It is up to the person hearing the argument to evaluate the accuracy of the claims made and decide whether they indeed have ethical ramifications for their lives.  

it is encouraged that you, the viewer, do the same. 

A word of caution.  There is a compilation edited into this talk that was shown in class and has images of slaughter houses that may be disturbing to some.  There is also language used by the speaker that some may find offensive.

DKyHqZyeQ-Q,The First Form of Discrimination You Are Taught | Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"A quick conversation between an animal rights activist and a non-vegan. The activist educated him on the first form of discrimination everyone is taught. 

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos.

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless. To join in on animal rights activism: cubeoftruth.com

From Democracy Now: Nearly 100 animal rights activists were freed today, after being arrested by police in riot gear for carrying out a rescue mission and protest at the Reichardt Duck Farm in Petaluma, California, which they accuse of engaging in animal torture. More than 600 activists with Direct Action Everywhere stormed the slaughterhouse Monday, fanning out in teams to chain themselves together at the entrance, freeing dozens of ducks and in some cases locking themselves by the neck to the slaughter line. Several of the activists made it inside the slaughterhouse, where they began trying to rescue ducks that were hanging upside down by their feet. Inside the slaughterhouse, the activists began using U-locks on their own necks, locking themselves to the metal duck slaughtering production line. An employee of the slaughterhouse then turned on the belt, threatening the lives of the activists and nearly asphyxiating Thomas Chiang, who was dragged by the neck and wedged against a metal pole. Chiang was later taken away by ambulance and treated for nerve damage and severe pain. He‚Äôs since been released from the hospital. We speak with Priya Sawhney and Wayne Hsiung, co-founders and lead organizers at Direct Action Everywhere. Hsiung was arrested during Monday‚Äôs action and was released late Wednesday. He is facing a total of 17 felony charges in jurisdictions around the country for his animal rescue actions. Sawhney is also facing felony charges.

I talked to Wayne as he prepared for the trial earlier in the year. He was optimistic, considering he had just beaten the attempts in Utah to convict him on similar charges. As we recount 2023, we reprise my conversation with Wayne in this encore podcast presentation.

These two men face over a DECADE in prison for removing 2 piglets they said were very sick as they videotaped themselves inside a massive Utah pig factory farm, described this way by the New York Times: ‚ÄúThe film shows sows with bloody and mangled teats; pregnant sows gnawing on the bars of the narrow stalls they live in until they give birth; and piglets clambering over and nibbling dead siblings.‚Äù 
Our team coverage includes commentary by famed former prosecutor Bonnie Klapper,  Marina Bolotnikova, who is reporting on the case for the Intercept, TheirTurn Founder Donny Moss, trial watcher Mick Davoudian and UnchainedTV founder Jane Velez-Mitchell. We are also going live to Utah and DxE Organizer Carla Cabral to find out what is happening on the ground in Utah, where protesters have gathered from around the nation.

Odagn88_E0A,A New Approach to the CARNIVORE vs VEGAN Debate,"Is it time to rethink the entire carnivore vs. vegan debate?

In this video from The Healthy Life, re-uploaded by Plant Based News, we hear a fresh perspective on one of the most heated topics in nutrition. Instead of choosing sides, this video challenges the processed foods both vegans and meat eaters often rely on‚Äîand shifts the focus to one simple principle: eat whole foods found in nature.

From nutrient density and gut health to longevity and ethics, this is a deep dive into what really drives health‚Äîbeyond the labels of carnivore or vegan.

üìå Why people feel better on both diets
üìå The real issue with junk food vegans
üìå What paleo humans actually ate
üìå The role of fiber, hormones, and cancer risk
üìå Why long-term health is about what you don‚Äôt eat

Let‚Äôs go beyond the extremes and get to the root of what matters.

Original video from @MarkusRothkranz here - https://youtu.be/gJdMRxYH0wA?si=fTw__0fpKKxI9mK8

y7HHbd0P4yo,Vegan called out on live TV! #veganism,"Just when you think you‚Äôve heard it all.

Some of you may remember Mike Parry from a TV segment where he referred to himself as a ‚Äòsausage expert‚Äô and yet ate a vegan sausage sandwich believing it to be meat. He called the vegan sausages ‚Äòluscious and lovely‚Äô before being told that they were vegan sausages. 

One of the many great things about a plant-based diet is that you can choose whether or not to eat a plant-based alternative. However, the reason plant-based alternatives exist is so that people can have the choice to eat a product that is similar to an animal product but is more ethical. Plus, as research shows, including a review of 43 studies, they are also more sustainable and healthier than their animal counterparts too. 

Study: Plant-based animal product alternatives are healthier and more environmentally sustainable than animal products. Future Foods, 2022.

‚ÄòThe time will come when men will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of man.""-Leonardo Da Vinci, and ‚ÄúI am in favor of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the way of a whole human being.‚Äù-Abraham Lincoln. And don‚Äôt forget, tomorrow Tuesday 11 a.m pst the art/animals/activism livestream on twitch!

In today's video, I debate Raphael, a student who believes that chopping up broccoli is ethically the same as slaughtering an animal. However, Raphael has some glaring contradictions in his own logic and it quickly becomes apparent that Raphael might not have considered the actual consequences behind his arguments.

YXCIGcn7lfU,Peter Singer: Still optimistic after 50 years of Animal Liberation?,"50 years ago, Peter Singer published Animal Liberation, the influential book that, among other things, called for a boycott of meat. It was the starting point of the animal movement as we know it today. Two years ago, he released a revised edition: Animal Liberation Now. How does he look back on 50 years of the animal movement? Where do we stand today, and which strategies should we pursue for the future?

Peter Singer is a moral philosopher, now retired as a professor of bioethics at Princeton University.

Today's video:

It's not breaking news to say that both #JoeRogan and #ElonMusk have a shockingly poor understanding of the realities of animal farming and veganism. However, even by their standards, their latest conversation is astonishing. It's actually impressive how demonstrably wrong they both are and how much misinformation they are able to spread in only a couple of minutes.

LiAy47Ic_Nw,Vegan Outreach Part 10,"Activist Support/Advice Weekly Reminder 

I'm about 95% sure I've outreached this individual in the past. He looked so familiar and his definition of veganism was a little too on point as well. I think a lot of it was weighing on him in this conversation. Most of the conversation he was just staring at the screen not saying anything. The whole time he looked as if he was getting very emotional. Guilt? Shame? Disappointed? I'm not sure.  When he took the information I gave him, he was very serious about watching everything. The animals hope he sticks to it this time around.

Don't miss out on opportunities to educate yourself to remove your supremacist mentality for other animals by going vegan. You too will live to regret not changing sooner. We all do 

Side bar: Outreach these days are night and day. Even at work it's all different. Once you become informed about what vegansim means, you know how to speak about it in a more effective and educated manner. There's no room for the usual morally bankrupt excuses people usually give. Very seldom if ever are they brought up. Leslie Cross' articles, Vegansim Defined, The Vegan Story and, The Surge of Freedom and most importantly listening and accepting feedback is what will ultimately help excel your advocacy which will ultimately propel animals even faster to their emancipated states.

CDXPz3QbUNo,THIS VEGAN WILL MAKE YOU THINK - Guy Scared To Watch Speech In Case It Makes Him Change,"Back on the streets again... encouraging and empowering people to live compassionately and to encourage them to make everyday choices that reflect the values that they already hold.

It was cool to have a conversation with someone from my home town!

If you would like to support my work I've taken the decision to start a Patreon. My reasons for doing so are on the link below...

https://www.patreon.com/ClifGrant?utm...

Ultimately I'm trying to make people stop for a moment and think - and to reconnect with the compassion for animals that already lies inside most of us.

If we take the time to inform people properly, together, one step at a time, one change at a time,  ‚Äì when it all adds up, it will be one enormous result for the animals.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I also hope to talk about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

UsVqTMN7T24,Joey Carbstrong Is Not Only Ill; He's Not Even Vegan ... Carneval,"Joey Carbstrong's mental health is clearly suffering...and he's not even vegan. Not according to the definition provided by the Vegan Society.

Carbstrong has said many times that Veganism is not about health. I guess he's backtracking now, trying to ""prove"" that the vegan diet is healthful because you can build little bird muscles on it while eating like a pig. Veganism, and this is the definition that Joey adheres to, is about minimizing animal suffering as much as possible and practicable. 
Now, we know that any food production, short of having your own veganic garden, and even that's dubious, necessitates animal suffering. Thus, there is no diet that doesn't kill animals, and this includes the plant-based diet. If that's the case, how do vegans, who eat exaggerated amounts of food, compared to people who eat TRUE nutrient-dense animal foods, how are these people minimizing the suffering of animals? It's dubious they do. 
Moreover, fat vegans or vegans who work out, in other words, vegans who over-consume calories, something which they don't have to do and is very easy not to, how are these people minimizing the suffering of animals as far as possible or practicable? They're not. 
None of these so-called vegans are really vegan. No vegan whose food comes from monocropping, is minimizing the suffering of animals, thus by definition, cannot be vegan. Definitely not the vegans who eat huge meals multiple times a day because they either wanna be fat or muscular. Joey Carbstrong most definitely eats more food than he has to, which logically necessitates animal suffering. More animal suffering than necessary.
Veganism is not about minimizing the suffering of animals. Veganism is nothing but a diet. It's a strict prohibition of consuming animal products. For nothing but religious reasons. Any vegan who tells you otherwise, is either ignorant, confused or just a liar. Prove me wrong. You can't...

yx2ddLulyJQ,INTENSE exchange between Speciesist and Animal Rights Activist  | Edmonton Vegan Outreach,"A speciesist stopped by a vegan demonstration to share her beliefs. Things got pretty heated...

Question? How would you have responded to her points? Would there have been anything different you would have brought up? Do you believe this speciesist has any authority to speak about health and how plant-based eating is unhealthier than her diet?

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos. 

***** What is Speciesism? *****
Speciesism, in applied ethics and the philosophy of animal rights, the practice of treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species; also, the belief that this practice is justified.
https://www.britannica.com/topic/speciesism

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** 
We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless.

The vegan actor delivered an unforgettable performance as Arthur Fleck in Todd Phillips‚Äô ‚ÄúJoker.‚Äù From press tours to acceptance speeches, Phoenix has used his time in the spotlight to shed light on important issues - including veganism, animal rights, and climate change.

Joaquin Phoenix condemned the dairy industry in his Best Actor acceptance speech at the 92nd Academy Awards. Phoenix won the Oscar for his performance in ‚ÄúJoker.‚Äù

Ahead of the BAFTA's, where he won the Leading Actor prize, Phoenix attended an animal rights protest. 

At the Golden Globes, Phoenix won Best Actor In A Drama Motion Picture. During his acceptance speech, he thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press for acknowledging the link between animal agriculture and climate change. It is also rumored that Phoenix influenced the decision to adopt a fully vegan menu for the ceremony. 

Following his win at the Golden Globes, Phoenix attended Jane Fonda's Fire Drill Fridays at the Capitol Building. He delivered a powerful message about individual efforts in mitigating climate change. He was also arrested for participating. 

Straight from the SAG Awards ceremony, where he picked up yet another award for his role in ""Joker,"" Phoenix attended a pig vigil. He wants to expose animal agriculture for what it really is. 

Which speech is your favorite?

********CRITIQUES, RULES, AND NOTES********

Be aware of the following rules before posting comments:
- Please do not post summaries of the video in the comments - it damages retention on the video and YouTube is less likely to promote it (these videos cost me a lot of money to produce). 

Critiques of my work are welcome! Please be aware of the following notes & rules before submitting critique:

Be mindful that this content is not all encompassing on the subject at hand and is self-limited for brevity to reach a wider audience. Also, be aware that I receive hundreds of YouTube comments per day, so the only way your critique can be considered is if you follow the steps outlined below. Finally, YouTube auto-deletes links, so I do not see most comments with links attached. 

RULES:
If your comment is rude, you will be banned.
If your comment is not about the studies/topics at hand (i.e. extending to other outcomes not discussed) or offers critique with no scientific basis, it is unlikely to receive a response.

If you can follow these rules, I will try to address your critique and if there is merit, I will add an AMENDMENT to the content in question and pin it so everyone can see it (thank you!).

w81NRCt6Z2I,BREAKING: WORLD-FIRST EXPOS√â | HUGE EGG HEN GAS CHAMBER SLAUGHTERHOUSE (UK),"*Background:* In August and September of 2024, In a world first investigation, my team and I captured the first ever footage from inside a CO2 gas chamber pit system used to kill end of lay egg hens. 

CO2 is an aversive gas, which burns the hen‚Äôs throat, eyes and lungs. Acidosis causes the hen‚Äôs blood and tissues to become acidic, as they suffocate in agony.

The hens clearly exhibit signs of severe pain, fear and distress with high-pitched vocalisations, gasping, and smashing into each other and the crates. 

And most shockingly, Many hens in a desperate attempt to escape the aversive gas, jump from the trays and fall many metres hitting the bottom of the pit.

The HCF Abattoir, in Bradford, is Red tractor and RSPCA assured, and kills over half of the spent layers in the UK, many of whom are from free range or organic farming systems.

The flesh from the birds is sold as chicken meat for human consumption in many UK outlets including butchers, restaurants and large supermarkets like Tesco, and many more.

Do not support the egg industry. Please live vegan.

1bkwJ72WSpk,Why Everyone Must Turn Vegetarian? Monk Explains #shorts,"#BBShorts

üéß Listen To #TheRanveerShow On Spotify:
https://open.spotify.com/show/6ZcvVBPQ2ToLXEWVbaw59P

In this very calming episode of The Ranveer Show, we have with us a monk who sold his Maserati.
Very early on Palga Rinpoche realized the true purpose of spirituality and understood that materialism is not the answer to long-term happiness.

This episode delves into Buddhism, spirituality, and achieving peace and happiness. Palga Rinpoche has had an interesting life, from being recognized as a reincarnation to experiencing extreme wealth at a young age to sleeping on the sidewalk when he was poor.

Spirituality is a term for which each one of us has a different definition. But all of them circle into the honest belief in a higher power, the universe, & our own versions of God. It is something that needs to be done from a feeling of genuineness and deep belief. From this episode, I truly hope you find the answers you were looking for.

FYI, this documentary was previously named ""Animal Rights Extremists: Terrorism vs. Protest"", but the name has recently been changed, we believe in the first half of 2020.

Did VICE cover-up the cruelty at a major Amazon farm?

Cassie and Wayne are discussing what VICE got wrong (and right) in its recent documentary about DxE... and the insidious problem at the root of all corporate media.

aBoKLPiA_OQ,Sharon N√∫√±ez on Wayne Hsiung Verdict: Insights from Animal Equality's President,"Animal Equality joins fellow animal protection organizations and nearly 100 of advocates to show support for Wayne Hsiung‚Äìan attorney who was recently jailed for rescuing sick and dying animals from factory farms.

On the farms, which are associated with Whole Foods and Costco, Hsiung and over a hundred advocates captured footage of criminal animal cruelty and neglect. Law enforcement did not seek legal action against the farm despite the evidence. Instead, Hsiung and fellow advocates were arrested, and Hsiung was convicted of two misdemeanors and one felony charge.

Today, November 30th, Hsiung faced years in prison. President, Sharon N√∫√±ez, and Executive Vice President, Jose Valle, traveled to Santa Rosa to show their support on behalf of Animal Equality. Ultimately, Hsiung was sentenced to 90 days of imprisonment and two years of probation, during which he will be prohibited from speaking to his colleagues.

jxWrb2tDEpA,Vegans Kill More Than Meat Eaters | Joey Carbstrong #shorts,"Vegans kill more animals and insects? Do you truly believe vegans are hypocrites because they ""don‚Äôt care about the animals in crop fields?‚Äù

This is no justification for eating meat but the best reason to go vegan. We also care about the mice, snakes, and other living beings in crop fields, which is why we choose vegan to reduce their suffering as well.

The animal agriculture industry is the driving force behind crop production and deforestation globally. A global shift to a plant-based diet uses less land overall, produces more calories, and hurts less animals.

Breakfast:
- 1 black coffee
- 1 ¬Ω cup steel cut oats (cooked)

OVftlaEITpE,Can A Vegan Diet Slow Aging?,"Can a vegan diet slow aging? ‚è≥

Dr. Christopher Gardner‚Äôs latest research offers some thought-provoking findings.
 
In a widely publicized twin study featured in the Netflix series ‚ÄúYou Are What You Eat,‚Äù one identical twin followed a vegan diet, while the other stuck to an omnivorous one.
 
Dr. Gardner and his team measured everything from cholesterol to telomeres‚Äîthe protective caps on the ends of your DNA that are linked to aging.
 
After just eight weeks, the vegan twins had longer telomeres than the omnivorous twins, a difference that was statistically significant. These results suggest a possible impact of the diet on the aging process. Even Dr. Gardner found the results surprising!
 
Watch the full Exam Room podcast episode for more fascinating insights from Dr. Gardner‚Äôs research.

We often view fish as being animals that have short memories and lack consciousness, so why should we care about them? Are they even sentient, or do they feel pain? In our new campaign 'School of Thought: Rethinking Our Relationship with the Oceans' we explore our relationship with fish, the oceans, and ultimately, how this connection impacts everyone on the planet.

What if I told you that millions of dogs and cats were being abused every single year, not just in  South East Asia, but instead in Europe, Australia, North America - everywhere? That as we sign petitions to stop people eating these animals, they are also suffering and dying on our doorstep as well?

We often refer to ourselves as a nation of dog and cat lovers. We love them in our homes, we love their company. But how often do we reflect on where these animals came from?

This is what the pet industry does to our dogs and cats.

tblLEiCJrUI,Selena Gomez can‚Äôt eat THIS animal.,"The fact that we draw a line when it comes to eating certain species of animals just shows how inconsistent and hypocritical our consumption of animals really is.

We eat the animals we do because of the cultures we are raised in, not because there is a moral difference between a pig and a dog, or a rabbit and a lamb. Our use and abuse of animals for food is completely contradictory and inconsistent, although it is definitely positive that we already recognise eating certain species of animals is wrong. However, it‚Äôs important that we align our actions with our values and recognise that in the same way eating dogs, cats and rabbits is wrong, eating pigs, cows, lambs and the other animals we eat is also wrong as well. #selenagomez #veganism",2024-01-09T18:42:42Z,Earthling Ed,29,[],PT44S,hd,false,61394,5257,921

April 24, 2018: DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung was arrested at a Boulder, Colorado Whole Foods for politely asking a question about where the meat comes from.

Wayne was released but Ateret, the camera person, was held in jail for longer. Ateret said and did nothing other than videotape the encounter, and they were charged by Whole Foods.

Call Whole Foods corporate and ask them to stop arresting teenagers for asking questions: 1-844-936-8255

You can also call the local store to make the same request: (303) 545-6611

Today's video:

In today's video I #debate Keane, a student in Boston who is unsure if k*lling homeless people is justifiable and thinks that growing humans in test tubes so that we can harvest their organs is ethical. However, how does all of this inform his views on eating animal products and can I get him to come around to veganism?

FTynqzv0cHg,Why Martin Freeman started eating meat again ü•©,"It is nothing short of outrageous that Martin Freeman can claim that he has gone back to eating land animals (he was pescatarian) because he‚Äôs worried about processed meat alternatives, while literally eating processed carcinogenic meat as he‚Äôs saying¬†it.

Not only that, but he then calls pork pies ‚Äòfood of the gods‚Äô. Pork pies are literally one of the most ultra-processed and unhealthy foods you can consume.

Unsurprisingly, the media jumped on Martin‚Äôs hypocritical and illogical comments, using them as another reason to slam plant-based alternatives and push a pro-meat and anti-science bias. Any credible journalism would have pointed out Martin‚Äôs hypocrisy, but who cares about logical consistency and journalistic integrity when you can use a clickbait headline.

The truth is, if Martin really cared about eating less processed food, then instead of going back to eating land animals, he should have just started eating a whole foods plant-based diet instead.",2024-06-12T16:54:23Z,Earthling Ed,29,"['earthlinged', 'earthling ed', 'vegan', 'veganism', 'why', 'be', 'go', 'ted talk on veganism', 'martin freeman', 'actor', 'ex-vegan', 'goes back to meat', 'gives up', 'being vegan', 'being vegetarian', 'processed meat', 'processed plant based', 'meat free', 'alternatives', 'vegan fail', 'owned', 'gets', 'destroyed', 'proof that', 'veganism is', 'unhealthy', 'unsustainable', 'unethical', 'meat', 'pork pies', 'scotch eggs', 'ultra processed', 'recipe', 'funny', 'rekt', 'podcast', 'response', 'reaction', 'angry', 'heated', 'commentary', 'outraged', 'triggered', 'debate', 'argument', 'hilarious', 'dairy']",PT1M,hd,false,29386,2721,264

‚úÖ Why is halal slaughter required in Islam?
‚úÖ Does the method of killing matter if animals don‚Äôt want to die?
‚úÖ Is eating meat necessary for survival, or is it just taste preference?
‚úÖ How would a peaceful god view factory farming today?

4tqq9aehD0U,Wayne Hsiung & Democracy Now: Protesters Punished While Letting Corporations Off for Animal Torture,"Wayne Hsiung & Democracy Now: Cops Punish Protesters While Letting Corporations Off for Animal Torture

JUNE 07, 2019 - Following the release of nearly 100 animal rights activists who were arrested for carrying out a rescue mission and protest at a Northern California duck farm this week, we speak with the founders of the group that coordinated the protest, Direct Action Everywhere. Priya Sawhney and Wayne Hsiung are both facing years of jail time for conducting a series of actions protesting animal torture in recent years. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Bonnie Klapper writes, ‚ÄúWhen law enforcement has become aware of the existence of animal cruelty, its response has not been to address [it]. To the contrary, the response has been to hunt down and arrest the rescuers and even attempt to return the injured, sick, dying animals to the agricultural facility.‚Äù

In this Animal Justice Academy event, we talk to Wayne about his journey leading investigations and rescues from factory farms and slaughterhouses across the U.S. with Direct Action Everywhere, serving as lead counsel for four ‚Äúright to rescue‚Äù trials of activists being prosecuted, his own criminal prosecutions and time in jail, and his new organization The Simple Heart Initiative.

We discuss topics including:

- the attempted silencing of animal advocacy and what we do to fight it
- how he's on pins and needles over the Ridglan Farms case decision that could mean freedom for 3000 beagles from a research breeding facility
- The Simple Heart Initiative's mission to build a mass movement for rescuing sick and dying animals in factory farms
- the elements that make open rescue such a powerful animal advocacy strategy
- how humans protecting the most powerless in our society is a necessary ingredient for building a more healthy, democratic world
- how we, as an individuals, can help to build a world where compassion is celebrated instead of criminalized

Peter Singer is a professor of bioethics at Princeton, best known for his 1975 book Animal Liberation, that makes an ethical case against eating meat. He has written brilliantly from an ethical perspective on extreme poverty, euthanasia, human genetic selection, sports doping, the sale of kidneys, and happiness including in his books Ethics in the Real World and The Life You Can Save. He was a key popularizer of the effective altruism movement and is generally considered one of the most influential philosophers in the world.

LYP606xesqo,Nutrients & Preventing Deficiency on a Vegan Diet!,"A pretty common concern is how to get nutrients on a whole plant food vegan diet. Turns out it is pretty simple, just eat a balanced diet of whole non-starchy vegetables, fruit, lots of whole starches, and include some nuts and seeds too. If you avoid any of these categories then it might make sense to supplement just in case. I'll talk through the whole list here.

In this episode of The Disclosure Podcast I speak with Mic the Vegan, a highly influential vegan educator and YouTuber, about what‚Äôs happening right now in slaughterhouses, as well as the possibility of the virus also being able to be spread through animals such as pigs. 

We also discuss whether or not a whole foods plant-based diet can help us in the fight against the pandemic, and how our diets could be making us more vulnerable to the virus.

SkRke88QKPs,Christopher-Sebastian McJetters - Queering Animal Liberation: Why Animal Rights is a Queer Issue,"Christopher-Sebastian McJetters, staff writer at Vegan Publishers, part-time lecturer on speciesism at Columbia University, and social media manager of Peace Advocacy Network, discussed Why Animal Rights is a Queer Issue  at VegfestUK London 2016 as part of the first-ever Pro-Intersectional Vegan Conference.

About this talk

This talk is a broad overview of the multiple connections between animal liberation and queer liberation from an American queer black perspective.

About the speaker

Christopher-Sebastian McJetters divides his time between London, England, and New York City. A copyeditor by profession, Sebastian is a staff writer at Vegan Publishers, teaches speciesism at Columbia University, and operates as social media manager of Peace Advocacy Network. He is also an offsite volunteer coordinator for VINE Sanctuary and senior editor for VINE Sanctuary Press. Plus, he sits on the advisory board for Black Vegans Rock and provides part-time writing and research support for A Well-Fed World. His work focus on examining the complex relationships between animal violence, anti-black racism, queer liberation and classism. He explains why veganism is a useful tool for deconstructing multiple systemic oppressions. His work has appeared in the anthology Circles of Compassion: Connecting Issues of Justice edited by Dr. Will Tuttle, Dr. Breeze Harper‚Äôs Sistah Vegan Project, Barefoot Vegan magazine, and the blog Striving With Systems in collaboration with Aph Ko (Aphro-ism), Brenda Sanders (PEP Foods) and Triangle Chance for All microsanctuary co-founders Justin and Rosemary.

Activists met at Gateway Boulevard on a busy Saturday afternoon to speak up for all oppressed animals. If you have never participated in one, get involved. 

Question for you (answer in the comments section). What is stopping you from going vegan today and joining the right side of history?

If you are vegan but not speaking up in any form for the animals, what is stopping you from protecting them from speciesism today? 

Edmonton Vegan Outreach was founded in 2019 with the goal to motivate people to get involved with vegan street activism. Most of the videos posted to this channel are street activism videos from Anonymous for the Voiceless: Edmonton Chapter. There are other solo activism videos such as the ""Change My Mind"" table or Vegan Response videos.

*****Attention all vegans in the Edmonton area***** 
We want you right beside us holding screens and fighting for the animals. An Anonymous for the Voiceless ""Cube of Truth"" is a peaceful form of activism. It involves the static holding of signs and tv screens so that powerful moments like this can happen. Don't hesitate. Join us today. We need your voice for the voiceless.

Transcript: 

""Nancy: I'm Nancy Grace. This is ""America's Most Wanted Overtime."" 

Tonight a female believed to be a homegrown terrorist who put first responders' lives in danger across the country, Josephine Sunshine Overaker, wanted for a string of arsons causing tens of millions of dollars of damage. 

Special guest joining us, Peter Young. Hold on to your seat: Convicted ecoterrorist, former fugitive on the run nearly a decade, and you can find him at peteryoung.me or on Amazon at ""Liberate"" his new book. 

Peter, you were, as they say, a politically motivated fugitive, AKA a criminal, much like Overaker. But what is different about the psyche of politically motivated fugitives?

Peter: What's different about criminals like Ms. Overaker or myself are that we're motivated simply by compassion. It's actually the opposite of what motivates most criminals. We are motivated by desire to save animals from horrific situations, such as slaughterhouses and labs, and because the extremity of what happens to these animals on laboratories and factory farms is so extreme, that we are forced to take extreme actions in order to save them.

Nancy: Can I ask you, sir, were you ever concerned about a first responder rushing into a burning structure that you had created and losing their life?

Peter: I never engaged in the act of arson. Let's just be clear about that. All I did was free animals from farms. However, arson, it's against the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) credo to ever put lives at risk. The ALF only sets fire to empty buildings and equipment like trucks. So there's never any risk of lives at risk.

Nancy: Peter, you and I, I assume we'll have to agree to disagree. I support your cause of saving animals, but I do not support arson where firefighters that I have worked with my entire career in public service can rush into a burning building and risk their lives. But hey, that's just me. 

Let me ask you about how you were able to avoid capture for seven years.

Peter: I was facing a life sentence for freeing mink and foxes from fur farms, literally 82 years in federal prison.

There's really only two rules of being a successful fugitive. Number one is to have a real ID under a fake name, which I accomplished, and #2, don't call your parents. If you could do those two things, the rest is just simply a matter of not getting arrested. So ultimately I was arrested for a petty offense and I had my fingerprints ran and that's how I was caught.

Nancy: Peter, you said you were caught on a petty offense and fingerprinted. What was the offense?

Peter: Shoplifting.

Nancy: Having been in similar shoes to Overaker, what do you think it will take for her to finally either get caught or surrender?

Peter: You have to understand the people that are surrounding her - and this is speculation -but I can speak to my situation. The people surrounding me, I had a $100,000 price tag on my head from the Fur Commission USA Trade Group. And the people around me knew that, and they still didn't turn me in despite that massive financial incentive. And the reason for that was because I was surrounded by people that shared my belief that animals are not here for us to kill, murder, and that sometimes we have to work outside the law to save those animals. 

I would have to imagine that financial motivation is not going to be what it's going to take to get people that are surrounding an animal rights fugitive to turn her in.

Nancy: You just heard Peter Young. He supports her to the hilt. 

Peter Young, so devoted to animal rights. Peter, I'm just as devoted to victims' rights and I have worked with so many fire people that risk their lives going into burning warehouses, maybe they were empty, but those firefighters go in and risk everything. That's my concern tonight. 

Peter. I want to thank you for being with us, Peter, convicted ecoterrorist, former fugitive for nearly a decade, author of ""Liberate"" on Amazon. You can find him at peteryoung.me. Peter, thank you for being with us.""

-eKCLlHMYKk,FBI Raids Animal Shelters Searching for Rescued Piglets with Wayne Hsiung and DxE,"FBI Raids Animal Shelters Searching for Rescued Piglets with Wayne Hsiung and DxE
Last week, FBI agents in bulletproof vests descended on two shelters for abandoned farm animals -- Ching Farm Rescue in Herriman, Utah and Luvin Arms in Erie, Colorado -- with search warrants, demanding DNA samples for piglets the agents said were named ‚ÄúLucy‚Äù and ‚ÄúEthel.‚Äù Activists with the animal rights network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), who recently rescued two dying piglets from a Smithfield farm in Utah in an investigation featured in The New York Times, say the FBI‚Äôs raids are intended to intimidate activists who are engaged in rescue and whistleblowing efforts. 

‚ÄúPiglets were rotting to death in piles of their own mother‚Äôs feces at Smithfield,‚Äù DxE co-founder and former Northwestern law professor Wayne Hsiung said. ‚ÄúRescuing them was an act of compassion, not a crime. But Smithfield doesn‚Äôt want the public to see the horrifying truth of how they produce their pork.‚Äù 


DxE activists say the actions by the FBI are an indication of the close ties between large agricultural corporations and the government that led to the passage of unconstitutional ‚Äúag gag‚Äù laws across the nation, which criminalize taking photographs at factory farms. Smithfield, with major operations in ag-gag states such as Utah and North Carolina, was a major beneficiary of those laws. With growing concern over abuse and consumer fraud in the meat industry, the activists say that producers are using illegitimate means to repress nonviolent activism. 


‚ÄúWe have people drowning in Houston, some of the worst wildfires in our nation‚Äôs history, a president tweeting about nuclear war, and federal prosecutors are concerned about a piglet caper,‚Äù University of Denver constitutional law scholar Justin Marceau, one of the lead counsels in the recent constitutional challenge to the Utah ag-gag law, said. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about piglets rescued from a dead pile. This is about a systematic crackdown on direct action of the sort celebrated by civil rights leaders. It is disgusting, and I look forward to hearing about the prosecution‚Äôs decision to prioritize a case against persons accused of rescuing pigs.‚Äù

The DxE activists say the FBI‚Äôs targeting of animal sanctuaries, who had no involvement in or knowledge of the Smithfield investigation, is a dramatic example of overreaching by the federal government. Federal agents even followed shelter volunteers back to their homes, dramatically confronting them in front of their families and neighbors. 


‚ÄúWe are quite open about the fact that we are documenting abuses and rescuing injured animals,‚Äù Hsiung said. ‚ÄúThe government doesn‚Äôt need to waste resources chasing piglets around the country, scaring senior citizens and families, when they can find all the details about our rescue on YouTube.‚Äù 


Hsiung says that activists are planning to hold a vigil at Smithfield‚Äôs Milford, Utah facility in response to the raids. Activists are also planning demonstrations at FBI and Department of Justice offices around the nation, asking the federal government to end surveillance and intimidation tactics of nonviolent animal advocates, including animal shelter volunteers.

GeqltSiQRWU,Wayne Hsiung: Homo Ahimsa Award Speech,"Our Interfaith Vegan Coalition bestowed our third annual Homo Ahimsa Award to Wayne Hsiung and Priya Sawhney, co-founders of Direct Action Everywhere and The Simple Heart Initiative, for trailblazing the ‚ÄúRight To Rescue‚Äù animals who are suffering or injured and in need of veterinary attention. Together, they created a precedent-setting campaign to gain public support for animal rescue, raise awareness about the political and legal repression of animal rescuers, and ultimately establish the legal right to rescue animals from abuse in the agricultural industry, where it is common practice.

Ahimsa is the Sanskrit word for non-harm and nonviolence. Venerated champions of the teaching include Mahatma Gandhi, who took a vow of ahimsa that informed his life and his activism. The Interfaith Vegan Coalition grants the Homo Ahimsa Award to those who embody the Homo ahimsa qualities of nonviolence and compassion for all beings. Homo Ahimsa Award recipients demonstrate how vegan living can co-create a world of peace, partnership, and loving kindness by ending violence and domination to people, animals, and the Earth. The award is named after the book, ""Homo Ahimsa: Who We Really Are and How We‚Äôre Going to Save the World,"" by the Interfaith Vegan Coalition‚Äôs co-founder Judy Carman, who coined the term.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In 2006, the United Nations stated:

‚ÄúThe livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.‚Äù

And then four years later, they warned that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty and the worst impacts of climate change.

So why exactly is animal farming bad for the environment?

r3WWtBUEi5U,Vegan vs Meat HEATED Oxford University 2024 Debate,"Debate: Would Oxford Union Go Vegan?

Back in December 2023, a debate expressed its support for veganism, with a majority of Oxford Union members agreeing with the motion ‚ÄúThis House Would Go Vegan.‚Äù

During the debate, Joey Carbstrong set out the ethical case for veganism. In the closing speech for the proposition, he outlined the harms that ‚Äúspeciesism‚Äù causes animals and wider society.

With more than 150,000 subscribers on YouTube, @JoeyCarbstrong is well known for his street interviews about veganism. Earlier this year, he released the first ever UK footage of pigs being gassed to death in a slaughterhouse. At the Oxford Union, Carbstrong talked about the ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù that humans commit against animals.

On the opposite benches was polemical media figure and far-right commentator Katie Hopkins. 

Her appearance had already caused backlash ahead of the debate. The Oxford Students‚Äô Union condemned her invitation to speak in the famous chamber. In a statement on social media, they condemned her for ‚Äúdenigrating Islam, blaming crime on multiculturalism, and expressing discriminatory views against various ethnic and social groups.‚Äù

8n5_W0MvZ40,This One Reason Why a Vegan Influencer Lost Her Life #veganism,"This One Reason Why a Vegan Influencer Lost Her Life #veganism Following a raw vegan diet can be an appealing choice for those seeking a plant-based and natural approach to nutrition. It emphasizes the consumption of unprocessed, uncooked plant foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and sprouted grains. While this diet can offer numerous health benefits, it's essential to recognize that there are potential drawbacks, particularly concerning malnutrition. One of the main concerns with a raw vegan diet is the risk of nutrient deficiencies. Unlike omnivorous diets that include animal products, raw veganism excludes all animal-derived foods and any cooked items. As a result, certain essential nutrients may be challenging to obtain solely from plant sources. Vital nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids are more readily available in animal products, and without proper planning, deficiencies may occur. Vitamin B12, for instance, is primarily found in animal products, and a deficiency can lead to anemia, fatigue, and nerve damage. While some raw vegan enthusiasts rely on fortified foods or supplements, not everyone may be aware of these options or be consistent in their use. Iron is another critical nutrient that may be less bioavailable in plant-based foods, leading to iron-deficiency anemia if not consumed in adequate amounts. Although plant-based sources of iron do exist, the body typically absorbs them less efficiently than iron from animal products. #RawVeganDiet #NutritionConcerns #BalancedEating #VeganHealth #PlantBasedNutrition #NutrientDeficiencies #MalnutritionRisks #HealthyEating #VeggieLife #VitaminB12 #IronDeficiency #CalciumSources #Omega3FattyAcids #DiverseFoodChoices #HealthAwareness #NutritionEducation #VeganLiving #PlantPowered #BalancedDiet #DietitianGuidance #RawVeganism #NutrientIntake #VeganLifestyle #NutritionalBalance #doctor #medicine #healthcare #interesting #fyp #fyp„Ç∑ #medicineexplained",2023-08-02T21:28:35Z,Dr Sermed Mezher,22,[],PT50S,hd,false,5021265,230003,8305

Today‚Äôs video:

When I was growing up, a day out at a zoo was one of my favourite activities. I loved seeing all the different animals and I never once questioned whether or not zoos were ethical, or if they actually did benefit the conservation of animals in the wild.

Interestingly, I stopped going to zoos before I became a vegan, with the last zoo I visited being Barcelona Zoo. I had recently seen the movie Blackfish and had become passionate about the captivity of marine animals, but I hadn‚Äôt yet extended that concern to the captivity of terrestrial animals as well.

However, as I was wandering around Barcelona Zoo I came across a bear enclosure, inside of which was a bear sat forlornly looking around. I followed the gaze of the bear as they looked at each of the walls of the enclosure and it suddenly hit me, these are wild animals being held captive. They have no agency, no chance of escape and no freedom.

We are often sold the idea that animals are well-cared for and happy in zoos and that zoos do important conservation work, but is this actually true? As is the case with farmed animals, we often mistake the fact that the animals are given food, water and medication as constituting care. However, providing the basic requirements for an animal to survive hardly constitutes genuine care and appreciation for the best interests of the animals.

It‚Äôs time to recognise zoos for what they really are, animal prisons that exist for the primary reason of making money.

Today‚Äôs video is an in-depth look into the ethics of zoos, and the arguments that they use to justify their existence.

Today's video:

In today's video, I have a really heartwarming conversation with Xavier, a student at UC Irvine. It can often feel really frustrating talking about veganism with people who are not yet vegan. However, talking to people like Xavier fills me with optimism and hope for the future. Here's hoping he made those changes!

Forum with with Wayne Hsiung
Sunday, February 9, 2025

The factory farming industry has been one of the largest contributors to the new administration and its key allies. These contributions have bought incredible influence, including tens of billions of dollars sent to industrial operations engaged in inhumane practices such as so-called ‚Äúventilation shutdowns.‚Äù Since 2022, more than 90 million poultry in 48 states have been ‚Äúeuthanized‚Äù due to the bird flu outbreak, which affects all animals. These factory farms cause depletion and pollution of our natural waterways and devastation to forests and natural resources. Now more than ever, we must be aware of this basic food production information.

Wayne Hsiung, a member of our UU Animal Ministry, is an attorney and internationally recognized animal rescuer and investigator. He co-founded animal rights organizations such as The Simple Heart Initiative. Wayne studied law and economics at the University of Chicago and taught at Northwestern School of Law and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Join us for this important update on our food systems and efforts to keep them safe and healthful!

Today's video:

If I could go back in time and tell my past self that I was going to go vegan, I would have laughed. You see to me, vegans were all protein deficient, hippy tree huggers, who loved forcing their extreme views onto other people. Why did vegans have to be this way? 

This is the story of how I went vegan, and how the seeds had been planted in my mind long before I made the change.

TODAY'S VIDEO:

In today's video, I am talking about ex-vegans. However, rather than focussing on this issue from the perspective of influencers making videos announcing they're no longer vegan, I wanted to approach this conversation by talking about everyday people who stop being vegan.

To do this, I focus on two types of vegans. The first being the vegan who dives headfirst into the community and becomes completely immersed in veganism, and the second being the person who goes vegan on their own with no support from their family or social circles.

Sadly people will overlook the obvious misinformation that Lizzo is discussing and use that fact that she has stopped eating a plant-based diet as a justification for why they continue to eat animal products. However, the fact that Lizzo seems to be unaware that you get protein from plants and thinks we should eat be eating a raw alkaline diet very obviously shows how ill informed she is about diet and nutrition. Considering this is the kind of research she‚Äôs been doing, we should be all be taking her claim that she did ‚Äòtests‚Äô and ‚Äòresearch‚Äô about animal protein with a massive pinch of salt.¬†

Also, it is clear that Lizzo never connected with the fact that veganism is not a diet and is about animals. Veganism is not about doing what makes us happy, it‚Äôs about being ethically consistent when it comes to our view of non-human animals. It is outrageous that she can claim that everyone should just do what makes them happy while overlooking the fact that she is condoning animals being mutilated, forcibly impregnated, forced into gas chambers and slaughtered.¬†#Lizzo",2024-11-10T19:26:10Z,Earthling Ed,29,[],PT1M1S,hd,false,26929,2352,219

These are questions vegans encounter all of the time, and at first they seem reasonable. After all, most of the problems associated with egg production don‚Äôt exist with eggs from backyard hens, so what would the problem be? #BackyardChickens

TODAY'S VIDEO:

Do you know what the only two foods on the planet that don't cause any death are? Spoiler alert, it's not plants. In today's video I respond (again) to Neil deGrasse Tyson's utterly bewildering thoughts about veganism. Unfortunately his views around veganism are becoming more and more absurd, and his cognitive dissonance is really being turned up.  #NeildeGrasseTyson

iVXsjWxaTFQ,"Animal Liberation Front (ALF) ‚ÄìRaid Interfauna, 1990‚Äì","17 March 1990 ‚Äì ALF liberates more than 100 animals from laboratory animal breeder Interfauna.

On this day in 1990 one of the most famous Animal Liberation Front raids in history was successfully completed. Activists broke into Interfauna, a supplier of animals for laboratories, and rescued 82 beagles and 26 rabbits. At that point it was the largest number of dogs taken in a single action.


El 17 de marzo de 1990 se complet√≥ con √©xito una de las incursiones del Frente de Liberaci√≥n Animal (ALF) m√°s famosas de la historia. Lxs activistas entraron en Interfauna, un proveedor de animales para laboratorios del Reino Unido y rescataron a 82 cachorros beagles y 26 conejos. En ese momento era el mayor n√∫mero de perros liberados en una sola acci√≥n. 

Aqu√≠ se cuenta la acci√≥n con todo detalle: 
https://network23.org/redblackgreen/2018/03/17/flashback-17-march-1990-alf-liberates-more-than-100-animals-from-laboratory-animal-breeder-interfauna/


* ¬øCual fue tu sensaci√≥n cuando o√≠as tu sentencia por la liberaci√≥n de Interfauna? ¬øDe cuanto tiempo fue? ¬øC√≥mo se hizo tal acci√≥n?

John Curtin: Recuerdo muy bien la sensaci√≥n que sent√≠ cuando recib√≠ la sentencia de 18 meses por una liberaci√≥n en Interfauna. ¬°Me sent√≠ bien! Mir√© fijamente al juez pensando ‚Äúno te atrevas a intentar darme lecciones‚Äù y dej√© que sus palabras me entrasen por un o√≠do y saliesen por otro. Pens√© en lo ir√≥nico de la situaci√≥n. Estaba tan feliz de pensar que, aunque me iban a encerrar en una jaula, 82 beagles y 26 conejos hab√≠an encontrado un hogar en el que los cuidar√≠an.

La acci√≥n de Interfauna es otra historia, como veo que esta entrevista se est√° extendiendo mucho, me limitar√© a decir esto‚Ä¶ la preparaci√≥n y ejecuci√≥n de la acci√≥n transcurrieron como un atraco a un banco, ¬°solo que mucho m√°s complicado! Tuvimos que planear la acci√≥n y hacer vigilancias durante semanas, para que quedase todo bien preparado. Esa noche tuvimos que trabajar realmente duro. Y despu√©s varias semanas de m√°s trabajo, buscando hogares seguros para los animales liberados. Pero el sentimiento que se tiene cuando ya ha terminado todo y ha salido bien‚Ä¶ te sientes alegre de haber nacido.

Keeping my meals simple and consistent has made it super easy to get back into a deficit and feel satisfied even while reducing calories after my bulk phase. I do 3 things every day:

1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Eat a filling breakfast like oats - this reduces nighttime cravings.

2Ô∏è‚É£¬†Eat a ton of potatoes and veg - low calorie dense and super satiating.

3Ô∏è‚É£¬†Cook without oil - I saut√© with water, saving myself 100s of calories daily. (I don‚Äôt add it to my stir fry either). This is the EASIEST way to reduce calories without affecting how full you feel.

1ReH7rK-HlQ,Vegan Outreach | Wikipedia audio article,"This is an audio version of the Wikipedia Article:
Vegan Outreach

Listening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading. Written
language only began at around 3200 BC, but spoken language has existed long ago.

Learning by listening is a great way to:
- increases imagination and understanding
- improves your listening skills
- improves your own spoken accent
- learn while on the move
- reduce eye strain

Now learn the vast amount of general knowledge available on Wikipedia through
audio (audio article). You could even learn subconsciously by playing the audio
while you are sleeping! If you are planning to listen a lot, you could try using
a bone conduction headphone, or a standard speaker instead of an earphone.


You can find other Wikipedia audio articles too at:

""Behind the Mask, a production of Uncaged Films and ARME directed and produced by Shannon Keith, is an outstanding and thought provoking documentary about the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Winner of numerous awards, the seventy-two minute investigative film weaves together interviews with some of the leading figures in the animal liberation movement with undercover footage of animals in laboratories, as well as being liberated and in loving sanctuaries. 

The films subtitle: ‚ÄúThe story of the people who risk everything to save animals,‚Äù is nothing but the truth. For more than thirty years the organization has been freeing nonhuman animals around the world and destroying property that causes harm to those animals totaling up in the hundreds of millions of dollars of ‚Äúdamage.‚Äù As the film explains, the ALF has been identified by the FBI as the number one domestic threat in the U.S. despite the fact that they are against harming any living creature human or nonhuman, and have not harmed anyone since becoming established in the mid-1970s.""

Today's video:

Non-vegans presume that the hardest part of going vegan is finding food or getting enough vitamin B12 and yet, in my experience and the experience of many vegans that come and speak to me, these are far from the hardest part of being vegan. So in today‚Äôs video, I thought I would sit down and chat about my experience as a vegan and what I genuinely struggle with. I‚Äôd love to know in the comments if you agree with what I say and for you to share your own experiences too.

Vegan Gains being too self righteous on YouTube, and it was getting on my tits. I started editing a little and started having way too much fun with it, and now here we are with the shortened version of my video being 10 minutes long. 
He's been flat out lying and covering up some facts while showing the ones he wants etc, and you can't be so self righteous given all that, man. I don't hate the guy like everyone else on YouTube seems to though, guy's got balls (if anyone thinks he doesn't, I'll show you he has some pretty damn big watermelon sized ones). 
Just stop being so self righteous, that's all I'm saying. Go back to your old videos, those were jokes.

App üëâ https://sovegan.app/go

Honestly, these noodles are hard to beat! They hit the spot every single time. They‚Äôre currently my go-to lunch when I‚Äôm cooking for myself because they‚Äôre quick, easy and use a bunch of ingredients I almost always have lying around.

üìö did you know we also have a new cookbook? EASY is out now and is packed with 100 QUICK + EASY plant-based recipes - check out the link in our bio to get your copy!

Serves 1

For the tofu:
üå± 120 g extra-firm tofu
üå± 1 tsp cornflour
üå± vegetable oil
üå± 1/4 tsp Chinese 5 spice
üå± 1/2 tsp light soy sauce
üå± 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce

For the noodles:
üå± 2 spring onion, chopped
üå± 1 garlic clove, peeled + finely chopped
üå± 1 tsp chilli oil, plus extra for topping
üå± 1 tsp light soy sauce
üå± 1 tsp dark soy sauce
üå± 1 tsp maple syrup
üå± 1/2 tsp rice vinegar
üå± 200 g ready-to-cook udon noodles, see notes

Use your hands to crumble the tofu in a bowl until it reaches a mince-like consistency, then stir in the cornflour.

Add a small drizzle of oil to a non-stick wok or frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook for 7-10 minutes or until golden and crispy, stirring occasionally to break up any clumps of tofu.

Reduce the heat to low, then stir in the 5 spice, dark soy sauce and light soy sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.

Meanwhile, for the noodles, add most of the spring onion (save some for topping), garlic, chilli oil, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, maple syrup and rice vinegar to a mixing bowl.

Cook the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, stirring gently to separate them. Then drain the noodles and stir them into the sauce.

Add the noodles to a serving bowl and top with the crispy tofu and remaining spring onion. We also love to drizzle extra chilli oil over the top, but this is optional! Enjoy!",2024-02-29T20:11:55Z,So Vegan,26,[],PT30S,hd,false,320462,12662,42

PLEASE SHARE! :D

When I watched this back, I thought I could have done much more to hold his feet to the fire - prod him to reflect further... hold him accountable.

But as I remarked, he was very visibly, to me at the time at least, uncomfortable - and keen to end the discussion, which is why I was so soft.

- To counter my concerns: there's no way of KNOWING what would have been best.
- perhaps the line I took, where I essentially described him as a ""lost-cause,"" was most effective...?

To be boxed into such a category - lacking in principle and ethical consistency...
That would have eaten away at me for sure.

That being said - he's not the ONLY person in the picture...

Thanks for watching!

0zLmycbiKNQ,DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung and ex pig farmer Brad Johnson who saved pigs,"Former Smithfield pig farm manager Bradley Johnson was deeply steeped in the industry. Then he met activists who would take him down a dramatically new path. When the company asked him to gas some of the piglets who were too small or weak for slaughter, he sent them to sanctuary instead. The Smithfield machine discovered his act of compassion, and Bradley was faced with dire consequences for his job, his family, and even his freedom.  Brad lost his car, his home, and his job because of the prosecution against him.  Brad is blowing the whistle on the industry and defending the right to rescue animals from abuse.

O6oJA_xhTa8,Can You Guess Her Age? -- Raw Vegan Diet Is Woman's Fountain of Youth,"A Florida woman says she has found the 'fountain of youth""

Annette Larkins shows off her garden in her Miami-Dade County backyard. It's full of fruits and vegetables. Every corner of her garden has something that is edible. She also collects rainwater to drink and water her plants. 

Annette says the food in her garden is her 'Fountain of Youth.' 

""I am very vibrant, I have lots of energy, as I told you before, I am up no later than 5:30 in the morning as a rule, and I am ready to go,"" she said. 

Full Story at WPTV: http://www.wptv.com/news/ageless-woman

Annette says she does not eat animal products-- her food is unprocessed and uncooked. ""My diet consists of fruits, nuts, vegetables and seeds. I do a lot of sprouting of seeds and as you can see from my garden and of course these are the raw foods that I eat.""

Annette also juices fruits and veggies. You name it, she can juice it. Grapefruits, pineapples, even spinach. But not everyone in the Larkins family eats and drinks this way. 


Amos says people even wonder if Annette is his wife. ""They will ask me 'what am I doing with a young girl? or they will say 'you've got your granddaughter with you,' things like that."" 

Annette says because friends and strangers kept asking her questions about her health and youthful appearance, she decided to publish two Journey To Health booklets, and she produced a DVD 12 years ago. 

""The Discovery Channel, they took sections of the booklet and translated them into Spanish which is, by the way, my second language."" 

Her husband says she is vibrant person. ""She is an amazing person, she does everything. I mean she builds computers, makes all of her own clothes, grows her own food, speak three languages, it's amazing.""

nkbjNZhx4zk,Vegans need to live and let live!,"One of the reasons I went vegan was to respect the personal choice of others. After all, if animals were given the choice they wouldn‚Äôt choose to walk into the gas chamber or the stun box. They wouldn‚Äôt choose to be selectively bred, for their bodies to be mutilated, their reproductive systems exploited or for their babies to be forcibly taken from them.

Everything we do to animals involves their subjugation and the denial of their best interests, preferences or what they would choose to do if given the opportunity to have a choice. So when we talk about personal choice, do we really care about the freedoms of others, or are we simply trying to deflect from the fact that morally we have no justification for the needless suffering that we choose to cause to animals?

z4F-5VROXvg,How To Do Short-Style Vegan Outreach (See Description),"#howto #vegan #outreach 

I define short-style outreach as conversations under 10 minutes. This is a good style to employ if you want to interact with more people in one outing.  

This style of outreach has 4 steps. 

Step one - introduce yourself and what you're doing
Step two - break the ice / try to understand who you're interviewing
Step three - spark interest (controversy)
Step four - conclude with a meaningful question 

It may be beneficial to end with a more explicit accountability question like, ""What can you do to prevent animals from being harmed in [insert specific scenario]?"", especially if you show a quick clip of the industry on a tablet or phone. 

While I don't think this was my best outreach conversation (warming up after some time away from street outreach), I think I still accomplished my goal which was to listen to what Mark had to say and introduce veganism to him as a way to treat animals with fairness. 

I feel like I could have improved this interaction by showing a video under three minutes and asking an accountability question at the end. 

I will attempt to follow up with Mark to see if he has gone vegan or reduced his consumption of animal products, as well as to send him some recipes. 

I would be thrilled if anyone who hasn't attempted outreach yet gave it a try because of this video. Best of luck!

0:00 Introduction
0:26 Icebreaker 
0:53 Spark Interest 
5:00 Meaningful Questions 

Special thanks to our only Patron Rachel DJ and Mark for taking time out of his day to interact with us.

cU2yNuDb1gk,VEGAN OUTREACH MADE EASY - Clif Grant on the Streets of Belfast,"*Please be kind to each other and about the people in my videos as many of them come to my channel to watch the videos. üôèüèº

Hey folks. I've been really ill with a bug I picked up for about a week but I'm happy to say that I have now fully recovered and I'm back on the streets again.  This was my first day back and I'm really happy about how these conversations went. 

Let me know how you think it went in the comments!!!

If you would like to support my work I've taken the decision to start a Patreon. My reasons for doing so are on the link below...

https://www.patreon.com/ClifGrant?utm...

Ultimately I'm trying to make people stop for a moment and think - and to reconnect with the compassion for animals that already lies inside most of us.

If we take the time to inform people properly, together, one step at a time, one change at a time,  ‚Äì when it all adds up, it will be one enormous result for the animals.

Ethical veganism means making everyday choices driven by the desire to avoid causing cruelty and suffering to animals at all practical costs. It is a way of life that reaches far beyond a plant based diet. 

Put simply - We oppose the exploitation and use of other animals. 

There is no doubt that breeding, caging and use of animals for food, clothing, experimentation and entertainment causes an immense amount of suffering... all of it completely unnecessary. 

Following a vegan lifestyle is easy and on this channel I will be navigating many of the challenges and socially ingrained ideas that animals are here for us to use.

I also hope to talk about 'activism'... and helping other vegans to communicate effectively and share the message of living without causing unnecessary harm to other beings.

I want to make change happen... for our health, for the planet and most importantly, for the animals.

I hope you will join me on our journey to change the world.

Who is Philip Wollen? (Find out more via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wollen);

""Philip was vice president of Citibank, specialising in corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions.

At age 34, he was rated by Australian Business Magazine in their Top 40 Australian head-hunted executives. At age 40, he witnessed cruelty on such a colossal scale that it affected him profoundly. He decided to give away everything he owned with warm hands, and die broke. 'And so far, we are right on budget,' he jokes.

Today he devotes his life to children, animals, the environment, the terminally ill, the homeless and the arts. He supports over 500 humanitarian projects in over 40 countries with schools, orphanages, shelters, sanctuaries, clinics, and scholarships.

In 2005 he received the Order of Australia. In 2007 he was Australian of the Year, Victoria. The Australia Day Council said of him, 'Essentially a private man, Philip Wollen seeks no personal publicity but is not afraid to step into the limelight for a just cause.' ""
